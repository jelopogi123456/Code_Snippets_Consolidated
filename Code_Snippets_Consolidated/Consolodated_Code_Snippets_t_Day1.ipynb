            "Content: Concerns are mounting for a Taiwan-based book publisher believed to have been detained in China, in a case that has echoed the disappearances in 2015 of five Hong Kong booksellers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Li Yanhe, also known by the pen-name Fucha, reportedly travelled to Shanghai last month to visit relatives but has been uncontactable since Thursday. His alleged detention was first reported by Bei Ling, a Chinese writer and activist, who said on Facebook that he had been told by various sources that Li had been arrested by authorities in Shanghai.\n",
            "\n",
            "Taiwan’s government has said it is monitoring the situation. Last week, a mainland affairs council spokesperson, Jan Jyh-horng, said Li was “safe” but declined to give further details, citing calls for privacy from his family. Taiwan’s premier, Chen Chien-jen, said the government was providing care and assistance to Li’s family.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bei later took down his Facebook post reportedly upon request of Li’s family, but the alleged detention has sparked concern in Taiwan and in east Asian academic and dissident circles. Under the rule of China’s leader, Xi Jinping, crackdowns on dissenters, human rights groups, and critics have intensified.\n",
            "\n",
            "Gusa is known for publishing books that are critical of the Chinese Communist party (CCP) or are politically sensitive, including about the Tiananmen Square massacre, human rights abuses of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and corruption within the CCP.\n",
            "\n",
            "Li was born in China but relocated to Taiwan in 2009, where he established Gusa Publishing. Colleagues at Gusa have said Li had since obtained citizenship of the Republic of China (Taiwan’s formal name), and was seeking to renounce his Chinese citizenship within the requisite three months under Taiwan law. Taiwan media also cited government officials as saying Li was being treated as a Taiwan national.\n",
            "\n",
            "The case has drawn comparisons to the detention of five booksellers connected to Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay Books, a seller of numerous critical, political and gossipy titles that had been banned by the CCP. In late 2015, the five were “disappeared” from various locations in Hong Kong, mainland China and Thailand, re-emerging later in Chinese detention.\n",
            "\n",
            "One, Gui Minhai, remains in detention, and in 2020 was sentenced to 10 years on charges of “illegally providing intelligence overseas”. Another, Lam Wing-kee, skipped bail in Hong Kong in 2016, later fleeing to Taiwan where he has since re-established the bookstore in Taipei.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lam told the Guardian on Monday that Chinese authorities would be treating Li as a Chinese national, whether or not he had renounced his citizenship to obtain Taiwanese citizenship.\n",
            "\n",
            "“From the point of view of mainland China, they think you’re from where you were born,” Lam said. “Li published some books in Taiwan that violated the laws of his own country. This is a more serious situation … Publishing these books is a risk. And it is an important warning to other Taiwanese publishers.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Supporters including the Gusa publishing house, where Li is editor-in-chief, PEN America, and dozens of writers, academics and activists have all voiced concerns for his safety.\n",

            "“Li is not the first publisher to be detained by China, which is also the world’s largest jailer of journalists,” said the TFCC on Monday, calling on Beijing to respect media freedom and release “all unjustly imprisoned media workers”.\n",
            "\n",
            "On Saturday, a group of more than 40 Asia-focused writers, media workers and academics joined Gusa Publishing on a statement calling for his release. It said Li had not had access to lawyers or family members and communication was restricted, according to a report by Taiwan’s CNA.\n",
            "\n",
            "“In Taiwan, freedom of speech and publication, and academic freedom are like the air we breathe. They are part of daily life for every reader, every author, every translator and every editor,” said the statement.\n",

            "Content: Australia’s defence strategic review paints an alarming picture of the “radically different” security outlook in the Indo-Pacific, including the risk of “major conflict in the region that directly threatens our national interest”.\n",
            "\n",
            "But it is important to be very clear about what Monday’s document does and doesn’t say about the threats Australia faces.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, the review by the former defence chief Angus Houston and the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith does not say Australia is at any significant risk of direct invasion. But it seeks to argue that this frame is too narrow to get a true picture of the regional outlook.\n",
            "\n",
            "Critics of the Australian government’s approach – including the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating – have sought to play down concerns about China’s rapid military buildup, saying it reflects the relative shift in power from the US and that Australia’s direct interests are not threatened.\n",
            "\n",
            "“All great battles are fought on land. They’re fought as invasions,” Keating said in his memorable outing at the National Press Club last month. “What would be the point of China wanting to occupy Sydney and Melbourne, militarily, and could they ever do it?\n",
            "\n",
            "“Could they ever bring the numbers here? It would be an armada of troop ships to do it. So you don’t need a briefing from the dopey security agencies we have in Canberra to tell you that.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But here is how Houston and Smith describe the risks to Australia. “While there is at present only a remote possibility of any power contemplating an invasion of our continent, the threat of the use of military force or coercion against Australia does not require invasion,” they say in their report compiled by the government.\n",
            "\n",
            "“More countries are able to project combat power across greater ranges, including against our trade and supply routes, which are vital for Australia’s economic prosperity.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Cyber warfare is not bound by geography. The rise of the ‘missile age’ in modern warfare, crystallised by the proliferation of long-range precision strike weapons, has radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits, the comfort of distance and our qualitative regional capability edge.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The review says “any adversary” could attempt to coerce Australia through cyber-attacks, incursions in Australia’s north-west shelf or parts of its exclusive economic zone or through disruptions to sea lines of communication.\n",
            "\n",
            "For years Chinese officials have been urging Australia to make a clear choice on whether it sees China’s rise as an opportunity for Australia or a security threat. The defence strategic review does not categorise it neatly into one of those binaries.\n",
            "\n",
            "It attempts, perhaps awkwardly, to reconcile the benefits of China’s economic development with concern about a military buildup “occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China’s strategic intent”.\n",
            "\n",
            "“China’s military build-up is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the second world war. This has occurred alongside significant economic development, benefiting many countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Australia,” the report says.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the report doesn’t categorise China as a direct military threat to Australia, it does say that Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in the contested South China Sea “threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests”. It labels intense competition between China and the US as “the defining feature of our region and our time” and warns of “the increased risk of miscalculation or misjudgment”.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the government’s formal response to the review, Richard Marles insists the government continues to view a “stable” relationship with China as being in the interests of both countries and the broader region and that they will seek to manage their differences “wisely”.\n",
            "\n",
            "In all likelihood, the Chinese government will criticise the language used in the report (Kevin Rudd’s defence white paper of 2009 triggered denunciations from Beijing for warning that “the pace, scope and structure of China’s military modernisation have the potential to give its neighbours cause for concern”).\n",
            "\n",
            "But the truth is that Australia’s defence settings – including the pursuit of nuclear-powered submarines as part of Aukus – were already factored in to Beijing’s calculations when it reopened the door to Canberra last year.\n",

            "\n",
            "The government has set the ADF a five-point mission that extends well beyond defending the continent and Australia’s northern approaches. In addition to these elements, the ADF will be asked to protect Australia’s economic connections, “contribute with our partners to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific” and “contribute with our partners to the maintenance of the global rules-based order”.\n",
            "\n",
            "In short, the ADF will seek to project military power further from Australia’s shores, including through the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines and longer range missiles.\n",
            "\n",
            "The strategic review also takes a look at the role of Australia’s top security ally, the US, which is “no longer the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific”.\n",
            "\n",
            "The review certainly doesn’t suggest walking away from the alliance, but argues Australia “must be more self-reliant”. It also calls for investing in partnerships with countries across the region, including south-east Asia and the Pacific.\n",
            "\n",
            "Australian officials have not forgotten the Donald Trump presidency, characterised by an “America First” approach that was openly dismissive or hostile to some of the US’s alliance partners. It seems unlikely Trump will be the last to give voice to an isolationist view in the decades ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was very brief when asked on Monday for his assessment of the reliability of the US as an ally in the decades ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The US remains an important ally. It’s a relationship between nations, it’s a relationship between peoples and it’s based upon our common values,” he said.\n",
            "\n",

            "In November 2021, a former navy officer who was the chief finance officer of Myanmar’s military-linked Mytel telecommunications company was fatally shot on a street in Yangon, the country’s commercial capital. Than Than Swe, then a deputy governor of Myanmar’s central bank, was shot at her home in Yangon in April 2022. She survived and was promoted to the bank governor.\n",

Darya Trepova, 26, is accused of killing Vladen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, on 2 April. He was presented with a statuette containing a bomb while giving a talk at a cafe in St Petersberg. Investigators say she was working on behalf of a pro-Ukrainian group with connections to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny – claims rejected by Navalny’s associates and Kyiv – and charged her with terrorist offences. A court in Moscow on Monday rejected Trepova’s appeal against being held in prison until at least 2 June, Reuters reports. The appeal was largely procedural and did not concern the substance of the charges against her. Trepova said she regretted what had happened and wished a speedy recovery to other victims, the Russian TASS news agency reported from the court. More than 40 others were injured in the blast. Trepova’s husband previously told independent Russian media outlets he believed she had been framed and had not known the statuette she had been told to deliver contained explosives. Tatarsky was among the best-known of an influential group of bloggers who have surged to prominence since Russia invaded Ukraine. They have often been scathing in their criticism of Russia’s defence establishment and its conduct of the war, pushing for a more aggressive assault on Ukraine. Last year, in a video shot at a ceremony in the Kremlin to mark Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions, Tatarsky said Russia should “kill everyone” and “rob everyone” in Ukraine.\n",

            "A new effort to impose a ceasefire on warring factions in Sudan appeared to be failing on Saturday, with continued fighting, airstrikes and bombardment in Khartoum, the capital. There were also renewed clashes in the Darfur region, in the south-west. More than 400 people are known to have died in the conflict so far, though the true toll is believed to be much higher. The conflict has pitted army units loyal to Sudan’s military ruler, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is the deputy head of the ruling council. Both believe they can seize unchallenged control of Sudan’s resources and its crumbling, but still powerful, state. Neither appears inclined to compromise, analysts say.\n",

            "\n",
            "According to the UN’s projections, which are calculated through a variety of factors including census data and birth and death rates, India now has a population of 1,425,775,850, surpassing China for the first time.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is also the first time since 1950, when the UN first began keeping global population records, that China has been knocked off the top spot.\n",
            "\n",
            "China’s population decline follows decades of strict laws to bring the country’s booming birthrate under control, including the introduction of a one-child policy in the 1980s. This included fines for having extra children, forced abortions and sterilisations. While initially highly effective in controlling the population, these policies became a victim of their own success, and the country is now grappling with an ageing population in steep decline, which could have severe economic implications.\n",
            "\n",
            "Part of the problem is that because of a traditional preference for boys, the one-child policy led to a massive gender imbalance. Men now outnumber women by about 32 million. “How can the country now shore up birth rates, with millions of missing women?” asks Mei Fong, the author of One Child, a book about the impact of the policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recent policies introduced in China trying to incentivise women to have more children have done little to stimulate population growth. Women still have only 1.2 children and the population is expected to fall by almost 10% in the next two decades. According to projections, the size of the Chinese population could drop below 1 billion before the end of the century.\n",
            "\n",
            "China’s ageing population is an obstacle to economic development, with the number of working age people in the country declining by 38 million in the last three years.\n",

            "In India, the population has grown by more than a billion since 1950. Though growth has now slowed, the number of people in the country is still expected to continue to rise for the next few decades, hitting its peak of 1.7 billion by 2064. Today on average 86,000 babies are born a day in India compared with just 49,400 in China.\n",
            "\n",
            "Poonam Muttreja, executive director of Population Foundation of India, said that while some were concerned at the implications of being the world’s most populous country, she said that India’s population growth was no longer facing the “explosion” many had feared.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Earlier projections said we would overtake China in 2027 so it’s happened four years faster, mostly because of our young population,” said Muttreja. “But at the same time, we have also reduced our population growth and reached population stabilisation faster than we had imagined and it will continue to slow down as long as we stay on the right track. So I don’t think there’s any need for alarm.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The exact size of India’s population is still not known, due to a delay in the government carrying out the census, which usually takes place every decade. It was due in 2021, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, has yet to announce the date it will commence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some have accused the Modi government of obstructing the census process in order to disguise data that could be politically disadvantageous. However, the government say the delay is due to an ongoing effort to incorporate technology into the process.\n",
            "\n",
            "The announcement by the UN is likely to increase pressure on the Indian government to carry out the survey. According to predictions the population has grown by almost 200 million – greater than the population of Brazil – since the last census in 2011 and experts say the lack of vital data is hindering policymaking and welfare programmes.\n",
            "\n",
            "India’s demography is far from uniform across the country. One third of predicted population growth over the next decade will come from just two states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in the north of the country, which are some of India’s poorest and most agricultural states. Uttar Pradesh alone already has a population of about 235 million, bigger than Nigeria or Brazil.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile states in India’s south, which is more prosperous and has far higher rates of literacy, population rates have already stabilised and have begun to fall. In the next decade, states in the southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu are likely to start grappling with an ageing population, and by 2025, one in five people in Kerala will be over 60.\n",

            "\n",
            "Many politicians in southern states have expressed concern that their successes in bringing down population numbers, through education programmes, family planning and high literacy, could result in a reduction in their political representation in parliament, and a further political domination of the northern states that continue to have a population boom.\n",
            "\n",
            "Currently the average age in India is just 29, and the country will continue to have a largely youthful population for the next two decades. A similar “demographic dividend” proved highly useful in China, leading to an economic boom, particularly in manufacturing.\n",
            "\n",
            "While India has one of the world’s fastest-growing economies in the world, and recently overtook the UK as the fifth-largest, experts have stressed that the country needs more investment in education and employment to seize the opportunity presented by a young population over the next few decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "India continues to struggle with high youth unemployment and less than 50% of working-age Indians are in the workforce. The figure for women is even lower, with just 20% of women participating in the formal labour market, a figure that is decreasing as India develops.\n",

            "The research suggests that the antimicrobial colistin, which was used for decades as a growth promoter on pig and chicken farms in China, resulted in the emergence of E coli strains that are more likely to evade our immune system’s first line of defence.\n",
            "\n",

            "“This is potentially much more dangerous than resistance to antibiotics,” said Prof Craig MacLean, who led the research at the University of Oxford. “It highlights the danger of indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in agriculture. We’ve accidentally ended up compromising our own immune system to get fatter chickens.”\n",

            "AMPs are compounds produced by most living organisms in their innate immune response, which is the first line of defence against infection.

            "The extensive use of colistin in livestock from the 1980s triggered the emergence and spread of E coli bacteria carrying colistin resistance genes, which eventually prompted widespread restrictions on the drug’s use in agriculture. But the latest study suggests the same genes also allow pathogens to more readily evade AMPs that form a cornerstone of our own immune response.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the study, E coli carrying a resistance gene, called MCR-1, were exposed to AMPs known to play important roles in innate immunity in chickens, pigs, and humans. The bacteria were also tested for their susceptibility to human blood serum.\n",
            "\n",
            "The scientists found that E coli carrying the MCR-1 gene were at least twice as resistant to being killed by human serum. On average, the gene increased resistance to human and animal AMPs by 62% compared with bacteria that lacked the gene. The study, published in the journal eLife, also showed that the resistant E coli was twice as likely to kill moth larvae that were injected with the infection, compared with the control E coli strain.\n",
            "\n",
            "MacLean said it was not possible to estimate how this might translate into real-world consequences, such as the risk of an E coli infection leading to sepsis and death. And the prevalence of these strains of E coli have dropped steeply since China banned the use of colistin as a growth promoter, suggesting that these genes carry other “fitness disadvantages” for the pathogens. However, the findings highlight a fundamental risk that has not yet been extensively considered.\n",
            "\n",

            "Antimicrobial resistance poses a dire global threat – the UN has warned that as many as 10 million people a year could be dying by 2050 as a result of superbugs – and so the need for new antibiotics is pressing. There is growing interest in the potential of AMPs as drugs, and some of those in development include drugs based on human AMPs.\n",
            "\n",
            "MacLean and colleagues are not calling for the development of such drugs to be put on hold, but say extremely careful risk assessments of the likelihood of resistance emerging and the potential consequences are required. “For AMPs, there are potentially very serious negative consequences,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dr Jessica Blair, of the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the study, said: “Antimicrobial peptides, including colistin, have been heralded as a potential part of the solution to the rise of multidrug-resistant infections. This study, however, suggests that resistance to these antimicrobials may have unintended consequences on the ability of pathogens to cause infection and survive within the host.”\n",

            "Cóilín Nunan, an adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, who was not involved in the study, said: “This new study shows that colistin resistance is probably even more dangerous than previously thought … It is also remarkable that the British government is still opposed to banning preventative mass medication of intensively farmed animals with antibiotics, even though the EU banned such use over a year ago.”\n",

Some remained skeptical that Carlson’s departure from Fox would be the end of his career despite critics who called out his show as racist and inaccurate. “I’d like to think Tucker Carlson’s departure is the end of an era, but I’m quite certain it’s the beginning of his political career,” the founder of gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action, Shannon Watts, tweeted. Several conservative pundits took to social media to express their displeasure at the announcement. “I STAND WITH TUCKER CARLSON!” the far-right Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert tweeted.

            "There, Lanser found a way back home to Chatswood through a “talking-machine shop” in Cairo, where in late December 1914 or early January 1915 he made what is believed to be the oldest surviving recording in the world of an ordinary soldier in wartime.\n",
            "\n",
            "The three-and-a-half-minute recording was made on a 10-inch shellac disc – a forerunner of vinyl – by the Mechian Company, which had been run by an Armenian businessman, Setrak Mechian, since about 1908.\n",

            "Like so many other members of the first battalion on leave in Egypt, the young soldier – described in his Red Cross papers as “tall, young and well made” – would have wandered the streets of Cairo seeing the sights during his first time overseas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before enlisting, Lanser had been a mechanic who travelled around NSW working on shearing equipment. Stephanie Boyle, a senior curator at the Australian War Memorial, believes Lanser’s interest in machinery may have been one reason he took the “unusual and expensive step” of entering a recording studio.\n",
            "\n",
            "“These recordings were being sold at 10 shillings a pop … that’s an extraordinary amount of money, the equivalent of nearly $60 on a novelty, so he must have really wanted to do it,” Boyle says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lanser tells his family in the recording: “The past week, training is getting heavier every day. My word, the Germans or Turks, as we hear, they are making for Egypt. Whatever happens we will stop them – from laughing anyhow – when we do start.”\n",

Sadly his life, like the recording, was “time limited”. He was killed by machine gun fire near the village of Flers in northern France on 5 November 1916.\n",

            "“As a toddler I remember holding that record, which had a piece broken out of it. And they played it where my aunties lived, and at that stage my grandmother – Lanser’s mother – was still alive,” Ian Lanser says.\n",

            "\n",
            "The audio nearly didn’t survive. The original 10-inch shellac disc came to the Memorial with a chunk missing, making it impossible to play.

            "\n",
            "Williams acknowledges the message mentioned an area which has largely outlawed abortion and three states which have acted to preserve access. The post did not explicitly mention abortion – because Williams’s day job was teaching Greek and Latin at a college for prospective Catholic priests near New Orleans.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Benedictine-run St Joseph Seminary College has a policy against publicly expressing beliefs contrary to the established teachings of the Catholic church, which stridently opposes abortion. Despite the fact that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to recent polling, Williams wanted to comply with school policy. It didn’t matter. The school fired him a week later.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Your Facebook post publicly and deliberately advocated a position contrary to the official teaching of the Catholic Church,” said the termination letter that St Joseph’s rector, Gregory Boquet, gave Williams on 5 July. “The decision is to terminate your employment … effective immediately.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Williams, 40, has no real legal recourse to compel St Joseph to rehire him, according to lawyers he consulted and attorneys interviewed by the Guardian. Louisiana is an at-will employment state, which means employers can dismiss workers for any reason that is not blatantly unconstitutional.\n",
            "\n",
            "Two New Orleans attorneys said it would be relatively viable to argue that Williams’s Facebook post should qualify as constitutionally protected political speech. But Megan Kiefer and Chris Williams both said the seminary could persuasively argue its constitutional right to religious freedom, expressed through its policy, trumped Greg Williams’s right to political speech.\n",
            "\n",
            "Greg Williams said he was now speaking up about the end of his seven-year tenure at St Joseph to shine a light on the harsh reality of at-will employment.\n",
            "\n",
            "He said he found the college hypocritical, because it is part of a church which spent decades trying to suppress information about child sexual abuse by its clerics. The archdiocese which includes St Joseph, and which serves about half a million Catholics, has identified more than 80 priests and deacons strongly suspected of abusing minors.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s a hell of a thing to have [the church] have an official letter addressed to me saying I’m doing heinous evil,” Williams said. “It’s like – what are you talking about?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Williams became a licensed pilot in 2009 and a couple of years later began flying for Pilots for Patients, a non-profit. Williams’s role mostly sees him fly people with cancer for chemotherapy and radiation treatments not available to them locally. He only knows what medical care passengers are receiving if they choose to tell him.\n",
            "\n",
            "Christian but not Catholic, he landed a role teaching at St Joseph, near Covington, Louisiana, in 2015. The seminary had no problems with his volunteer work or other things that set his lifestyle apart from those of his students, including that he planned to start a family with his wife, Macey.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then the supreme court handed down its abortion ruling, in the Dobbs v Jackson case. As an Episcopalian, Williams said, he wishes he lived in “a world where abortion isn’t needed any more” because he believes life begins at conception and therefore a terminated pregnancy is “a terrible tragedy”.\n",
            "\n",
            "“But that’s just not the world we live in,” he added. “And my personal belief about abortion is, I’m not going to be in that position as a man, and there’s all kinds of stuff that might lead somebody to make that decision.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Williams said his role at St Joseph did not present opportunities to impose his personal beliefs on his students, and he wouldn’t have done so even if it were possible. When, weeks after the Dobbs ruling, he decided to offer to fly any women in need of out-of-town medical care, he did so on a private Facebook page.\n",

            "\n",
            "The complainant’s identity has never been shared with Williams, whose termination letter was emailed by Boquet, the school rector. The same day, Williams’s academic dean provided a glowing recommendation for his search for a new job.\n",
            "\n",
            "“In all of his courses he was evaluated with the top 10% of our faculty,” read the recommendation letter from Daniel Burns, who described Williams as “a dynamic lecturer” and “infectiously passionate”.\n",

            "\n",
            "St Joseph officials did not respond to requests for comment. Pilots for Patients provided a statement saying flights for abortions fall outside the organization’s mission but acknowledged it does not control what trips its unpaid volunteers might take on during their own time.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "He noted an irony. For all of St Joseph’s talk favoring life, he said, the only thing delaying his plans to have a baby with Macey has been the school’s decision to fire him.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Having lost my job … I can’t afford it,” Williams said. “You want to talk about pro-life? They’ve literally prevented me and my wife from starting a family.”\n",

            "According to the UN’s projections, which are calculated through a variety of factors including census data and birth and death rates, India now has a population of 1,425,775,850, surpassing China for the first time.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is also the first time since 1950, when the UN first began keeping global population records, that China has been knocked off the top spot.\n",
            "\n",
            "China’s population decline follows decades of strict laws to bring the country’s booming birthrate under control, including the introduction of a one-child policy in the 1980s. This included fines for having extra children, forced abortions and sterilisations. While initially highly effective in controlling the population, these policies became a victim of their own success, and the country is now grappling with an ageing population in steep decline, which could have severe economic implications.\n",
            "\n",
            "Part of the problem is that because of a traditional preference for boys, the one-child policy led to a massive gender imbalance. Men now outnumber women by about 32 million. “How can the country now shore up birth rates, with millions of missing women?” asks Mei Fong, the author of One Child, a book about the impact of the policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recent policies introduced in China trying to incentivise women to have more children have done little to stimulate population growth. Women still have only 1.2 children and the population is expected to fall by almost 10% in the next two decades. According to projections, the size of the Chinese population could drop below 1 billion before the end of the century.\n",

Though growth has now slowed, the number of people in the country is still expected to continue to rise for the next few decades, hitting its peak of 1.7 billion by 2064. Today on average 86,000 babies are born a day in India compared with just 49,400 in China.\n",

            "\n",
            "“Earlier projections said we would overtake China in 2027 so it’s happened four years faster, mostly because of our young population,” said Muttreja. “But at the same time, we have also reduced our population growth and reached population stabilisation faster than we had imagined and it will continue to slow down as long as we stay on the right track. So I don’t think there’s any need for alarm.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The exact size of India’s population is still not known, due to a delay in the government carrying out the census, which usually takes place every decade. It was due in 2021, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, has yet to announce the date it will commence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some have accused the Modi government of obstructing the census process in order to disguise data that could be politically disadvantageous. However, the government say the delay is due to an ongoing effort to incorporate technology into the process.\n",
            "\n",
            "The announcement by the UN is likely to increase pressure on the Indian government to carry out the survey. According to predictions the population has grown by almost 200 million – greater than the population of Brazil – since the last census in 2011 and experts say the lack of vital data is hindering policymaking and welfare programmes.\n",
            "\n",
            "India’s demography is far from uniform across the country. One third of predicted population growth over the next decade will come from just two states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in the north of the country, which are some of India’s poorest and most agricultural states. Uttar Pradesh alone already has a population of about 235 million, bigger than Nigeria or Brazil.\n",

            "Meanwhile states in India’s south, which is more prosperous and has far higher rates of literacy, population rates have already stabilised and have begun to fall.

            "Currently the average age in India is just 29, and the country will continue to have a largely youthful population for the next two decades. A similar “demographic dividend” proved highly useful in China, leading to an economic boom, particularly in manufacturing.\n",
            "\n",
            "While India has one of the world’s fastest-growing economies in the world, and recently overtook the UK as the fifth-largest, experts have stressed that the country needs more investment in education and employment to seize the opportunity presented by a young population over the next few decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "India continues to struggle with high youth unemployment and less than 50% of working-age Indians are in the workforce. The figure for women is even lower, with just 20% of women participating in the formal labour market, a figure that is decreasing as India develops.\n",
