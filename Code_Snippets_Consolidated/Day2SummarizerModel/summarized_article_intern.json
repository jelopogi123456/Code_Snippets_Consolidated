As ordained by God. My daughter, Olympia.\"\n\nThe US athlete miraculously managed to rule the bodybuilding world despite ensuring the sport came second to his family.\n\nThroughout his decade-long career he held the might Mr Olympia title a whopping eight times between 1984-1991, establishing himself as one of the most decorated athletes in the game.\n\nHaney, known as Hercules, had an incredible streak that rivalled the likes of Ronnie Coleman thanks to his incredible physique and phenomenal work ethic.\n\nHe even broke Arnold Schwarzenegger's record of seven wins in a row.\n\nHe favoured a three-day on, one-day off training routine throughout his career - which allowed him to juggle his responsibilities as a dad.\n\nAnd yet, even with all his talent and regimented routine the star admits that he suffered with the pressure.\n\n\"When you're on top, there is nowhere to go but down,\" Haney revealed in an interview with the founder of Labrada Nutrition, Lee Labrada.\n\n\"The pressure of how do I stay here, what can I do differently to bring about a better package than the last time.\"\n\nHercules continued: \"All of those things run through your mind - and if you don't keep it together, that can create a lot of stress.\"\n\nThe ex-athlete explained that he was only able to \"maintain his sanity\" due to the unwavering support from his beloved wife Shirley.\n\n\"My wife was there with me,\" he continued. \"I was a husband, I was a father.

audacious attack on Moscow to mark the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion, leaked spy documents have revealed.\n\nThe mass strikes were ultimately called off after the United States intervened and warned Kyiv its plan could lead to a nuclear war between the West and Russia.\n\n4 Ukraine planned to mark the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion with attacks on Moscow\n\n4 Russian media has shared images of a Ukrainian drone crashed near Moscow Credit: East2West\n\n4 Plans to attack the Russian capital were hatched by Major General Kyrylo Budanov\n\n4 Black smoke seen billowing from a Russian airbase just after the invasion's anniversary Credit: East2West\n\nTensions have been mounting amid Russian nuclear sabre-rattling with Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Vladimir Putin's security council, saying the world is \u201csick\u201d and on the brink of \u201ca new world war\u201d.\n\nUkrainian drones have already crashed near Putin\u2019s capital while Kyiv has been suspected of behind sabotage attacks carried out near the city.\n\nThese include explosions and fires at shopping malls as well as energy facilities.\n\nThe plans for the February 24 attack on Moscow by Ukraine\u2019s HUR military intelligence, were revealed in classified documents seen by the Washington Post.\n\nUkraine\u2019s intelligence boss Major General Kyrylo Budanov instructed his officers to prepare for \u201cmass strikes\u201d with \u201ceverything HUR had\u201d, the National Security Agency documents reveal.\n\nAs well as attacks on Moscow, the Ukrainians also mulled over hitting the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.\n\nBut officials in Washington appear to have gotten wind of the plans and became anxious they could have sparked a wider military clash.\n\nInitial attempts to persuade the Ukrainians appear to have been unsuccessful after it emerged Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service also had plans to attack Moscow.\n\nThe CIA circulated a report saying that \u201cthere is no indication\u201d the SBU had \u201cagreed to postpone its own plans to attack Moscow\".\n\nThen two days before the attack would have gone ahead, the CIA said the HUR \u201chad agreed, at Washington\u2019s request, to postpone strikes\u201d.\n\nWhile Ukraine held off from an attack on Moscow to mark Russia's invasion, just after the anniversary, a Russian airbase was rocked by massive explosions following a suspected drone strike.\n\nThe documents indicate US intelligence is eavesdropping on Budanov\u2019s communications.\n\nThey also reveal tension between Kyiv and Washington over the extent to which US made weapons can be used to carry the war into Russia itself.\n\nSo far the reluctance to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine has been interpreted as stemming from US fears they could be used in attacks that could escalate the conflict.\n\nMoscow is around 280 miles from the closest point in Ukraine in a straight line but has so far not been directly hit though Kyiv appears to be continually trying.\n\nA suspected Ukrainian drone was discovered just miles from the Russian capital in a potentially major new danger to Russia on Monday.\n\nThe drone appeared to have evaded the capital's air defences which have been massively strengthened in recent weeks.\n\nThe news follows reports that Ukraine is preparing for a major strike to retake Crimea and humiliate Putin.","14":"THIS is the moment burger fans brawled in a drive-thru road rage clash.\n\nThe shocking footage was captured outside an In-N-Out in Valencia, California, as the fight started

bystanders as In-N-Out workers intervened Credit: Key News Network\n\nIn the three-minute video, two furious families can be spotted hurling juice and water bottles at each other.\n\nAnd a witness told NBC that at one point, one of the participants even began throwing a bottle labelled as \"bleach\".\n\nAs the altercation suddenly started out of nowhere, bystanders watched on in shock.\n\nA woman with red hair was seen exiting her white vehicle before approaching a grey Subaru and throwing a drink over the bonnet.\n\nAs the families continued to yell at each other across the drive-thru line, In-N-Out workers could be seen trying to split up the brawl.\n\nIt remains unclear what triggered the messy fight between the two families, but it has been reported that a woman from the white car told a bystander that they were hit by the Subaru.\n\nWhile the altercation continued to spiral, the burger joint staff can be seen on their phones and shaking their heads.\n\nThe two women from the white car were allegedly accused the family in the Subaru of being racist and repeatedly throwing liquids at their vehicle.\n\nA male then stepped out of the Subaru to watch the verbal altercation between the driver of his car and the white vehicle in front of them.\n\nBut this resulted in the redhead coming back for more before throwing another drink all over the young man.\n\nOnce the woman returned to her white vehicle, two men from the Subaru left their car with bottles of liquids in their hand.\n\nThey then stormed over to the white vehicle in front and splashed it with the contents.\n\nThe pair can then be seen running back to their car and jumping in before slamming the doors shut as a woman from the white vehicle steps out.\n\nThe chaotic road rage battle continued to get more out of hand as she slammed her fists on the Subaru's hood and confronted the other diver.\n\nThen all of the passengers in the Subaru exited their vehicle and gathered round the driver as they resumed the screaming match with the two women from the white car.\n\nThe fight remained heated for several minutes before a man got involved and told them to get back in their cars.\n\n\"Move forward, just get in your car and move forward,\" the man yelled.\n\n\"You have all these people,\" he says, pointing towards the line of people waiting behind the cars.\n\nThe footage ends with the families getting back into their vehicles while the empty bottles from the brawl are left on the ground.\n\nSanta Clarita Sheriff's Station officials told KTLA that deputies responded to reports of a \"verbal argument,\" but said that neither of the families wanted to press charges.\n\nThe shocking video made its rounds online and has racked up millions of views on multiple social media platforms.\n\nOne Twitter account called @FightHaven posted the video after claiming the altercation had broken out \"after the car in front ordered the last of the strawberry milkshakes\"\n\nThe post amassed thousands of comments from users online, both in stitches and astonishment at the brawl.\n\nOne joked: \"The only place you can get a burger, fries, a payper view fight with a car wash\".\n\nAnother said: \"You can't be serious lol.\"\n\nA third commented: \"I like how the In-N-Out guy just starts shaking his head, like here we go again\".\n\nOne more chimed in: \"I thought they were all trying to share food and wash each other's cars.

with some having more prosaic or tragic explanations - all eyes remain on the Kremlin.\n\nMany of the deaths are particularly strange - but then get ruled as \"suicide\" and quickly swept under by the Russian authorities.\n\nColonel Vadim Boyko was shot five times in his office.\n\nDespite being left riddled with bullets however, the military chief's death was deemed as self inflicted.\n\nAnd then there is the mysterious case of Pavel Antov, who died alongside his friend Vladimir Budanov.\n\nThe duo both died while Antov, a millionaire sausage tycoon and politician, was celebrating his birthday at a hotel in Odisha, India.\n\nBudanov - described as Antov's companion - was found dead in his hotel room.\n\nAnd then just days later the tycoon was found dead in a pool of blood having apparently fallen from the hotel.\n\nHis death came just days after he criticised Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nAnd then in the space of just one month, three businessmen - Vasily Melnikov, Vladislav Avayev, and Sergei Protosenya - died alongside their families in a trio of apparent \"murder-suicides\".\n\nPutin's war in Ukraine continues to grind forward - with the Russians making small gains in the country's East.\n\nKyiv continues to call for Western support to help them defeat Putin, who has so far lost more than 187,000 soldiers.\n\nVlad foolishly believed his forces would be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators when he invaded last February.\n\nBut instead the initial attack ended in a disaster which saw his forces devastated and thrown back to Russia.\n\nAnd the world is now waiting to see what Ukraine's long await counter offensive will look like - whether they will attack Crimea or try to punch through the Russian lines.\n\n2 Bortsov was a wealth soft drinks boss - who once sold a company to PepsiCo","20":"THE woman suspected of causing the deadly bomb blast that killed a pro-Putin blogger in Russia earlier this month has been seen for the first time in weeks.\n\nDaria Trepova, 26, was seen via video link handcuffed in her jail cell while appealing charges of terrorism for the April 2 St Petersburg bombing.\n\n9 Daria was seen in newly released photos as she appealed charges Credit: AFP\n\n9 Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, seen moments before the explosion Credit: East2West\n\nPro-Putin blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed by a TNT-packed figurine, allegedly gifted to him by Daria at an event in a local cafe.\n\nDaria was filmed giving a partial confession to the Federal Security Service (FSB), where she was asked if she understood why she was arrested.\n\nShe replied: \"I would say, for being at the spot of the killing of Vladlen Tatarsky.\"\n\nHer husband Dmitry Rylov has stood by his wife, and believes she was framed.\n\nDmitry told journalists: \"I am completely sure that she would never have been able to do something like this on her own.\"\n\nRussian officials arrested Daria for \"a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death\", and her appeal against the charges was denied by authorities this week.\n\nMoscow City Court ruled that Daria would remain in custody for two months while they investigate further.\n\nThey claim Daria is a supporter of Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, one of Putin's most famous enemies.\n\nEarlier this month, video emerged of the moment the bomb detonated in the packed cafe, injuring 30 and killing Tatarsky instantly.\n\nIn the video, 26-year-old Daria can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.\n\nThe former art student appears to be trying to edge out of the room -

confirmed their belief that Levi likely drowned in the city\u2019s port the morning after he was last seen.\n\nHis passport had been found in the area in November.\n\nCops told Julie that four cruise ship staff saw a person in the water, shouting for help in English, wearing a light-coloured T-shirt like Levi was seen in at 6.30am on October 30 \u2014 eight hours after he was last spotted on CCTV.\n\nA lifebuoy was thrown to him but a subsequent search by police and the coastguard found nothing.\n\nThe news stunned Julie.\n\nSpeaking for the first time about the revelation, she told The

recorded a video on his phone which he sent to Julie.\n\nBeaming with clear crystal waters behind him, he said: \u201cLook mum \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nWhen he docked Levi headed for The Old Irish Pub \u2014 where the last CCTV footage showed him leaving alone with a rucksack.\n\nSpanish police say there were subsequent sightings of him at the Hard Rock Cafe, which is a 12 minute walk away.\n\nJulie, who was the last person to speak to him the night he disappeared, said: \u201cI got a call from Levi at about 1am our time asking to borrow \u00a330 for a room so he could spend the night in Barcelona.\n\n\u201cHe said he would pay me back because he was waiting for wages.\n\n\u201cThat was the last I heard from him.\u201d\n\nThree days later, Julie started to realise something was wrong.\n\nShe said: \u201cI started to worry and after four days I just had a horrible feeling.\n\n\u201cI started calling friends who said they hadn\u2019t heard from him either.\u201d\n\nJulie called West Midlands police and the British Embassy, while Levi\u2019s friend Richard filed a missing person report with cops in Barcelona.\n\nBy February, the disappearance took a sinister twist.\n\nAn Instagram story on his page posted four days before he disappeared emerged with shocking claims.\n\nThe video \u2014 saved by a friend \u2014 opened with: \u201cMy name is Levi Davis and my life is in danger.\u201d\n\nHe then spent 15 minutes talking about being blackmailed by unknown people who had taken pictures of him in \u201ccompromising positions\u201d, claiming his life and his family\u2019s life were under threat.\n\n\u2018Family\u2019s lives in danger\u2019\n\nThree weeks later cops announced that they did not think Levi had \u201cgone missing voluntarily and doesn\u2019t want to be found\u201d.\n\nA spokesman added: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an adult male whose disappearance doesn\u2019t have a logical explanation and which we\u2019re therefore treating as disturbing.\u201d\n\n4 Levi played rugby professionally for Bath and later Ealing Trailfinders Credit: Getty\n\n4 In 2019, Levi performed on X Factor: Celebrity with fellow rugby players Ben Foden and Thom Evans Credit: Rex Features\n\nThey also revealed that after leaving The Old Irish Pub he had sent a voice note to a friend describing Barcelona as \u201camazing\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m literally just getting all my inspo. I love it. It\u2019s so good.\u201d\n\nJulie insists that Levi was being blackmailed and that his mental health deteriorated under pressure.\n\nShe was so convinced her son was telling the truth about the sinister plot that they made a complaint to police in March 2021.\n\nJulie says: \u201cAbout a year before he went to Ibiza, he told me he was being blackmailed over a video.\n\n\u201cI remember him saying that his life, and possibly our lives as a family, were in danger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been discussing it with him and trying to make sense of it.\n\n\u201cHe said that (the video) happened around the time of The X Factor and when he met this person they became friends, but now realised that they were only acquaintances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been racking my brain to think who it could be.\n\n\u201cMy feeling is he didn\u2019t want to say too much in case it led to one of the family getting hurt.\u201d\n\nThe day before Levi travelled to Barcelona he also posted pictures of himself on adult site OnlyFans.\n\nBut Julie says that sounds out of character and believes he only joined the site to have some control over the blackmail.\n\nShe says: \u201cI remember Levi saying that he was being forced to go down that road.\u201d\n\nReports that Levi owed \u00a3100,000 also emerged in Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia.\n\nGavin Burrows, a private investigator helping the family, revealed that Levi may have fled his flat two years ago to escape a Somali drug gang after accruing a \u201csizeable debt\u201d.\n\nBut Julie said Levi was not a habitual drug user.\n\nShe said: \u201cThese conspiracy theories, they are not Levi.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nLevi spent part of his life in foster care and went on to win a prestigious boarding school scholarship thanks to his rugby skills.\n\nJulie revealed that Levi\u2019s mental health deteriorated during lockdown after leaving Bath to join Ealing Trailfinders and Worthing Raiders, before suffering a ligament injury.\n\nBut she says it was made much worse by the blackmail threat.\n\nWorried Julie said: \u201cHis deterioration was an accumulation of lockdown, the rugby, issues he had over getting paid while not playing, his injury and not being able to train.\n\n\u201cThen there was the blackmail and that I think was highest on the list of things that troubled him.\n\n\u201cI have no doubts at all he was being blackmailed, though to what extent I don\u2019t know.\n\nJulie now wants a judge to authorise Spanish Port Police to carry out a search of the waters and other inaccessible areas of the port.\n\nUntil she finds out exactly what has happened to Levi she says she will not lose hope.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult.\n\n\u201cI take it one day at a time.\n\n\u201cLevi would tell me to control what I can control and leave the rest alone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve often said that to each other in dark moments.\n\n\u201cHe would tell me to carry on as normal and look after the family \u2018because without you mum, the family would fall apart\u2019\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t ever give up hope.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it and I won\u2019t believe it until the police say, \u2018Here\u2019s the body\u2019.\u201d","27":"A WOMAN discovered by chance that she was one of the three babies switched at birth at a maternity ward in Brazil 28 years ago.\n\nThe huge blunder came to light when Raylane Amaral, 28, did a DNA test and discovered her mother wasn't related to her, which led to a mystery that went far deeper.\n\n5 Raylane Amaral never knew until this year she had been switched at birth as was not related to the family that raised her Credit: Raylane Amaral\/CEN\n\n5 Raylane and her mother Marlucy (pictured right) unearthed the traumatic discovery through a DNA test Credit: Raylane Amaral\/CEN\n\nThe shocking discovery was made on January 24 after Raylane, who lives in the US now, tried to piece together her Brazilian family tree.\n\nThe drama deepened when she learnt through her DNA that she had a sibling who had completely different parents.\n\nSoon, her findings would uncover a far deeper web of mistakes that revealed two other girls had been switched at birth and had grown up with the wrong families.\n\nAt least three babies were switched at the Dr Deodato Cartaxo Maternity Hospital in Cajazeiras, Paraiba State on August 5, 1994.\n\nIt all started when Raylene uploaded her DNA test to MyHeritage and quickly was notified about the possibility of a male biological sibling, Lennon.\n\nRaylane told local media: \"The first feeling was one of surprise...thinking 'what do you mean, a brother?'\n\n\"Immediately after being surprised, I got excited about the possibility of having a half-brother on my father's side.\n\n\"The shock was even greater when I realised it would be a 'full' sibling, with both the same father and mother.\"\n\nIf neither Raylane nor her recently discovered brother Lennon Carvalho had used the website, the switch would likely never have been discovered.\n\nFor 28 years, neither had suspected anything was amiss.\n\nRaylane had never questioned the physical differences between her and her family, whom she visits at least once a year after her relocation to the US five years ago.\n\n\"It was a huge shock and also very painful to bring this news to my family, especially to Mum,\" she said.\n\nRaylene found her brother on LinkedIn and wrote to him saying: \"This is probably going to be the weirdest message you'll ever receive...Are you, by any chance, from Paraiba and have you done a DNA test with MyHeritage?\"\n\nOver LinkedIn, Raylane explained her very high DNA match with Lennon and began to ask him questions.\n\nLennon, 30, now lives in Ireland and has two sisters: Michele and Milena, who grew up in Brazil with their mother, Luisa Maria.\n\nIt transpired that Raylane was born in the same hospital and on the same day as his sister Milena.\n\nThe wait for the DNA result was painful. Time seemed to standstill. Raylane Amaral\n\nAfter studying her profile picture, Lennon quickly noticed physical similarities between her and his mother, Luisa Maria.\n\nLennon wrote back saying: \"So, I don't know what to say. You look just like my mother. I don't know what to think.\n\n\"In fact, there has always been a story that when my mother was giving birth to my sister, there was another woman also giving birth in the same room and at the same time.\"\n\nLennon then broke the news to his mother. Once the initial shock had died down, Raylane and Milena began arranging a DNA test.\n\nRaylane said: \"The wait for the DNA result was painful. Time seemed to stand still. The anxiety to have a definitive answer was very high.\"\n\nShe continued: \" I had a lot of hope that everything could be just a mistake in the first result and a great coincidence that Milena and I were born on the same day and place.\n\n\"It would be much easier for everyone.\"\n\nIn early February, Raylane found out the shocking truth that she was not biologically related to the woman who raised her, Marlucy, but instead to Luisa Maria, who raised Lennon and Milena.\n\nThe drama continued to unfold when Milena discovered she was not related to either Luisa Maria or Marlucy - meaning a third baby had been switched.\n\nRaylane said she felt relieved in part but still unable to rest knowing that her mother, Marlucy, had not yet found her biological daughter.\n\nSo she desperately continued to search for the mystery women from Cajazeiras born on the same date in the same ward.\n\nRaylane discovered a woman who looked strikingly similar - Marcelma Bezerra, who lives in a rural area of Cajazeiras.\n\nA DNA test confirmed that Marcelma was in fact the daughter of the woman who raised Raylane, Marlucy.\n\nMarcelma told local media: \"I am more relieved, compared to the apprehension 20 days ago. I am better, I am trying to reconcile, to join, to be one family, never to divide.\"\n\nNow, the families hope that the distressing puzzle is solved.\n\nIf Milena is confirmed as the daughter of the woman who raised Marcelma - the saga comes to a close.\n\nIf the DNA test is negative, it means that yet another baby was involved in the switch.\n\nAlthough Raylane is happy that her mother has finally found her biological daughter, she hopes that justice will be served.\n\nShe wants the person responsible for the switch will be found and held to account.\n\n\"I really hope it was a mistake, an accident... All of this is already so traumatic that finding out that it may have been done intentionally would bring us more suffering.\n\n\"But I hope that the person responsible appears and pays for it,\" she said.\n\nThe maternity hospital's legal department has stated that no records for that fateful day in August 1994 have been found among its files.\n\nAs it stands, it remains an ongoing mystery as to why the switch happened and who did it.\n\n5 Raylane's biological mother, Luisa Maria who raised Lennon and Milena (who was also switched at birth) Credit: Raylane Amaral\/CEN\n\n5 Marialucy who found out that Raylane was not her biological daughter, but that Milena was Credit: Raylane Amaral\/CEN","28":"An attack on the prison holding deposed Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has raised questions about his whereabouts, with one of the warring sides saying he is being held in a secure location and the other alleging he has been released.\n\nAl-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for three decades was overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the international criminal court (ICC) for genocide and other crimes committed during the conflict in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region in the 2000s.\n\nThe Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which together had removed al-Bashir from power during mass protests, are now battling one another across the capital. The fighting reached the prison over the weekend, with conflicting reports about what transpired.\n\nMilitary officials told The Associated Press that Bashir, as well as Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein and Ahmed Haroun \u2013 who both held senior security positions during the Darfur crisis \u2013 had been moved to a military-run medical facility in Khartoum under tight security for their own safety.\n\nThe army later accused the RSF of donning military uniforms and attacking the prison, saying they released inmates and looted the facility. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, denied the allegations and claimed that the military \u201cforcibly evacuated\u201d the facility as part of a plan to restore al-Bashir to power.\n\nFormer official Haroun, who is also wanted by the (ICC), said that he and other former officials of Bashir\u2019s government had been allowed to walk free, in a statement aired on Sudan television. He said they left the prison for their own safety because of the fighting and a lack of food or water.\n\nHaroun also said he was ready to appear in front of the judiciary whenever it was functioning and would take responsibility for his own protection. It was not immediately clear if Bashir, who has spent extended periods in a military hospital, with him.\n\nBoth the military and the RSF have sought to portray themselves as allies of the country\u2019s pro-democracy movement who are trying to restore its transition to civilian rule. But both joined forces to remove civilian leaders from power in a coup less than two years ago.\n\nKober prison held a number of activists detained after the coup. One of them who walked free, Ahmed al-Fatih, said he was willing to surrender at a police station but could not find any that were functioning amid the unrest, according to a statement released by his defence lawyers. Both activists said their lives were in danger at the prison as food and water ran low.\n\nVideos circulating online appear to show a long line of prisoners leaving the facility with bags of belongings slung over their shoulders.\n\nThe ICC indicted Bashir, Hussein and Haroun on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Darfur.\n\nThe Darfur conflict erupted when rebels from an ethnic African community launched an insurgency in 2003, complaining of oppression by the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum. Al-Bashir launched a scorched-earth campaign that included air raids and attacks by notorious Janjaweed militias \u2013 tribal fighters who stormed into villages on horses and camels.\n\nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this report","29":"From 7h ago 17.36 BST UK PM says more than 1,000 people in Sudan contacted for evacuation Sunak added there would be \u201cmany more\u201d flights out of Sudan on Wednesday as citizens make their way to the airfield. \u201cWe now have over 100 people on the ground in Sudan.

The prime minister added more than 1,000 people had been contacted.\n\nThe UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said evacuations on C130 Hercules and A400M planes would take place for as long as is possible. Germany was expected to fly its sixth extraction service on Tuesday, rescuing a total of almost 500 people.\n\nPlans are in hand for Sudan\u2019s army commander and de facto leader of the country, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, to meet the head of the RSF , Mohamed Hamadan Dagalo , known as Hemedti, according to a newspaper in Egypt.\n\nThe RSF has claimed that the Sudanese army has breached the 72-hour ceasefire. Gunfire and airstrikes were heard in Khartoum and Omdurman, according to news agencies on Tuesday. The RSF\u2019s claims have not been independently verified.\n\nThere is a \u201chigh risk\u201d of a biological hazard incident, according to the World Health Organization , because one of the warring factions has taken control of the national public laboratory in Sudan, which holds samples of diseases including polio and measles. \u201cThere is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s Nima Saeed Abid .\n\nThe UN refugee agency has said there could be further displacement of people, as thousands have already streamed into neighbouring Chad and South Sudan . Since the outbreak of the fighting on 15 April, at least 20,000 Sudanese have fled into Chad and about 4,000 South Sudanese refugees who had been living in Sudan have returned to their home country. One projected refugee total from the UN is as high as 270,000.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee has raised concerns about 3,000 people who have arrived at the Tunaydbah refugee camp in east Sudan, adding to the 28,000 refugees who already live there. An official has said the organisers believe more people will arrive at the camp, which has grown by more than 10% since fighting broke out.\n\nUkraine said it had evacuated 138 people, including 87 of its own citizens, from Sudan to Egypt during the ongoing ceasefire.\n\nTwo buses evacuating South African nationals from Sudan have arrived safely at the border with Egypt, a spokesperson for South Africa\u2019s Department of International Relations and Cooperation has said.\n\nFrance has helped to airlift Irish citizens out of Sudan, according to the country\u2019s ambassador to Dublin.

But Putin has been invited to a summit in South Africa of the Brics group (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in August and the Kremlin has said the Russian leader will take a decision nearer the time on whether he would attend.\n\nRamaphosa told reporters on Tuesday: \u201cThe governing party, the ANC, has taken the decision that it is prudent that South Africa should pull out of the ICC largely because of the manner in which the ICC has been seen to be dealing with these types of problems.\u201d\n\nWithin hours however, his office issued a statement saying \u201cThe presidency wishes to clarify that South Africa remains a signatory (to the ICC).\u201d\n\nThe statement said the \u201cclarification follows an error in a comment made during a media briefing held by the governing African National Congress.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa is a signatory to the ICC\u2019s founding document, the Rome statute, and would be obliged to obey the arrest warrant, but the government has long complained of what it deems to be the court\u2019s double standards.\n\nSouth Africa began proceedings to leave the ICC in 2016 after a dispute over whether to arrest the former Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, who visited for an African summit while under ICC indictment for genocide and crimes against humanity.\n\nHowever, the government recently suspended those proceedings in the face of legal obstacles, and on Tuesday the ANC\u2019s national executive committee put out a statement noting the decision at the party conference this year that \u201cthe ANC and the South African government must rescind the withdrawal from the ICC court\u201d. At the same time it urged ratification of a protocol to lay the ground for an African court of justice and human rights.\n\n\u201cSo the president appears to have messed up the message \u2013 ANC has decided to rescind notice of withdrawal from the ICC and NOT attempt to withdraw from ICC again,\u201d Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, a South African lawyer and director of the Africa programme of the International Commission of Jurists, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cSomeone in the ANC has erroneously briefed the president when in fact the ANC has taken a decision to rescind the withdrawal from the ICC not to commence withdrawal anew. Is there any quality control happening?\u201d\n\nEven if South Africa took the decision to leave the ICC, it would still be bound by its membership obligations, including executing arrest warrants, for 12 months following its notification of withdrawal.","31":"Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has said his country should apologise and take responsibility for its role in the transatlantic slave trade, the first time a leader of the southern European nation has suggested such a national apology.\n\nFrom the 15th to the 19th century, 6 million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported across the Atlantic by Portuguese vessels and sold into slavery, primarily to Brazil.\n\nBut so far Portugal has rarely commented on its past and little is taught about its role in slavery in schools.\n\nRather, the country\u2019s colonial era, which subjugated countries including Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, Cape Verde and East Timor as well as parts of India, is often perceived as a source of pride by most Portuguese.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday at Portugal\u2019s annual commemoration of the 1974 \u201cCarnation\u201d revolution, which toppled the country\u2019s dictatorship, Rebelo de Sousa said the country should go beyond just an apology, though he did not offer up any specifics.\n\n\u201cApologising is sometimes the easiest thing to do: you apologise, turn your back, and the job is done,\u201d he said, adding the country should \u201cassume responsibility\u201d for its past to build a better future.\n\nRebelo de Sousa made the remarks after the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was in Portugal on his first visit to Europe since assuming the office, addressed the Portuguese parliament. Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1822.\n\nBrazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, (l) greets Augusto Santos Silva, president of the Portuguese parliament, on the last day of his state visit to Portugal on 25 April.

But they were told they had to make their own way to the airbase, despite the chaos and risk of a flareup in the violence.\n\nThe UK had been criticised for first rescuing only its diplomats from the embassy on Sunday, and then appearing relatively slow in rescuing other citizens compared with Germany and France.\n\nHowever, Sunak said he was pleased the UK was \u201cone of the first countries to safely evacuate our diplomats and their families\u201d and added it was right they were prioritised because \u201cthey were being specifically targeted\u201d in early fighting.\n\nBetween Sunday evening and Tuesday lunchtime Germany had evacuated 490 people from 30 countries in five flights from the Wadi Seidna airbase. A final German flight was due out on Tuesday evening.\n\nBen Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said an emergency processing centre at the airbase, protected by 120 troops, had been set up by mid-morning.\n\nAt that point he said RAF flights out would start \u201cif and when the Germans leave\u201d.\n\nHowever, the first flight took off with Germany still running air traffic control, although preparations were in hand for UK forces to take it over.\n\nFrance had also been using the airbase to conduct its own rescue operation via Djibouti. It said it had rescued 538 people from 41 countries, operating nine round-trip flights and 10 convoys from Khartoum to ferry people to the airbase.\n\nThe US flew out diplomatic staff by helicopter on Saturday, but the Biden administration insists it had no plans to evacuate other US nationals or US-affiliated civilians.\n\n\u201cWe are providing the best possible advice we can about conditions, safety and security so that they can make their own decisions with the most information possible,\u201d state department spokesman Vedant Patel said on Tuesday, adding: \u201cIt is not standard practice for the US to send the US military into war zones to extract US citizens.\u201d\n\nAsked about the other countries evacuating their nationals, Patel replied: \u201cEach country is going to make its own sovereign decision based on their own interpretation of the security apparatus and the security situation on the ground.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Britain had deployed a contingent of Royal Marines already, Wallace said, and he said he had directed HMS Lancaster, a frigate, to sail there.\n\nThe idea was, he added, to keep an alternative evacuation point \u201cup our sleeve for contingencies\u201d because \u201cif the airbase were to close it would be one of the few options left\u201d. Many people have made the 35-hour road journey to the city from Khartoum, scene of much of the fiercest fighting so far.\n\nAt 1pm UK time, the Foreign Office told Britons and their immediate families to head to the airfield, supplying its GPS coordinates on social media, although with phone and internet connection intermittent it was unclear how widely the message was received.\n\nAndrew Mitchell, the minister for development and Africa, said the UK evacuation operation at the airfield was working but spasmodic. He told the foreign affairs select committee he did not know of any examples of people contacted to come to the airport being unable to make it and said those who have arrived \u201chave come under their own steam\u201d.\n\nHe insisted it had been right not to try to extract British nationals earlier as it was preferable to wait for a ceasefire. He said it had been necessary to evacuate British diplomats as they were in extreme danger. He rejected suggestions that the UK could have foreseen the crisis.\n\nAid agencies operating in Sudan said the 72-hour ceasefire between the army and RSF paramilitaries appeared to be largely holding, but many Britons in the country said they were concerned about the risks of making the journey.\n\nThose being rescued have to fly a four- to five-hour journey to Cyprus before being sent on fresh planes to the UK. Only British passport holders are eligible for evacuation, plus their spouses and children under 18, as long as they too have the right to enter the UK.\n\nPriority would be given to family groups with children, elderly people and individuals with medical conditions, the Foreign Office added.","33":"By the time Britain\u2019s first civilian evacuation flight had taken off from a rough airfield north of Khartoum on Tuesday afternoon, other European nations were highlighting their successes in evacuating hundreds of their citizens from Sudan.\n\nBritain\u2019s military may have been the first to use the Wadi Seidna base on Sunday afternoon, with permission of Sudan\u2019s embattled government, to evacuate two dozen diplomatic staff, but the UK then passed on control of the airport to Germany.\n\nAt that point, with fighting between the Syrian government and RSF rebels still raging in and around Khartoum, Germany and France began their own evacuation process. Germany took over air traffic control and five flights had departed between late on Sunday and Tuesday lunchtime. A sixth and final German rescue flight, flying via Jordan, was due to leave on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe first five flights had evacuated 490 people from 30 countries, highlighted as a \u201chuge achievement\u201d by the country\u2019s foreign secretary Annalena Baerbock.\n\n\u201cIt was important to us that, unlike in other countries, an evacuation not only applies to our embassy staff, but to all local Germans and our partners,\u201d Baerbock added, in an undiplomatic sideswipe at the policy pursued so far by the US and, until Tuesday morning, the UK.\n\nCriticism in Britain had mounted on Monday following the rescue of 24 embassy staff in a risky operation that involved elite forces, probably from the SAS, picking them up in Khartoum and taking them to Wadi Seidna since no evacuation had been offered to the 2,000-plus other stranded Britons.\n\nThat changed shortly before 7am on Tuesday when James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, announced the UK was \u201ccoordinating an evacuation\u201d. A Hercules transport, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, took off early in the morning with 130 Royal Marines and consular and immigration staff on board.\n\nThey arrived at the airport to set up and were ready around 11am, and with the ceasefire just about holding, a message went out from the Foreign Office telling people to travel \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to the airstrip, whose location was spelled out with GPS coordinates and the What Three Words mapping app.\n\nPeople in Britain worrying about relatives in Sudan, though, remained concerned. Manal, a doctor in London, told the Guardian she had been lost contact with her 77-year-old mother, who had gone to attend a wedding in the country, because phone and internet connections were down.\n\n\u201cHow is the government or Foreign Office or whatever going to contact people now?\u201d the doctor said at lunchtime. Later on Tuesday, said she had finally reached her mother and brother, also in the country, but said they had not been personally by the Foreign Office told to head to the airbase.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, it was returning to base largely empty, and as Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, was to explain in a late lunchtime update, there was a slight complication.\n\nPressed by Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, as to when the first flights with passengers would take off, Wallace told MPs that RAF flights out would start \u201cif and when the Germans leave\u201d, explaining that Germany\u2019s military was \u201crunning the airfield at the moment\u201d.\n\nIt was a surprising answer, highlighting how the UK had fallen behind. Two hours later it emerged the first British evacuation flight had finally taken off, making the four to five hour trip back to Cyprus and safety \u2013 given permission to leave by the German-run air traffic control.\n\nOther countries meanwhile were winding down. France\u2019s defence ministry said its rescue Operation Sagittaire (British officials were declining to say on Tuesday what the UK equivalent was called) had conducted nine return flights, rescuing 500 people from 40 countries, and had laid on 10 convoys to the airbase.\n\nBut despite being behind France and Germany, the UK was notably ahead of the US. As night fell in Sudan, there was still no sign of a US airlift for its 16,000 civilians in country, even though it was the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who had helped broker the 72-hour ceasefire.\n\nTwo more British flights from north of Khartoum were expected overnight, expected to rescue several hundred and bring them back to the UK and elsewhere from Wednesday. And a contingent of Royal Marines remained in Port Sudan, where Wallace had directed the frigate HMS Lancaster to dock, in case the airstrip was suddenly shut down by a breach in the ceasefire.","34":"Venezuela\u2019s best-known opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, has touched down in the United States after being unceremoniously ejected from Colombia while attempting to gatecrash a summit about the political future of his crisis-stricken homeland.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 shot to fame in early 2019 and for a brief moment looked poised to topple Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, with the support of dozens of foreign governments including the US, UK and Brazil.\n\nBut four years later the 39-year-old\u2019s star has waned dramatically as a result of his failure to unseat Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s political heir. Maduro has crushed street protests and consolidated power. Most of the international community has abandoned Guaid\u00f3\u2019s parallel \u201cpresidency\u201d and \u201cinterim government\u201d.\n\nAnd key regional powers such as Colombia and Brazil have elected leftist leaders who have revived ties with Maduro\u2019s administration and condemned Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempt to bring it down by using foreign pressure to spark a military uprising.\n\nLate on Monday, Guaid\u00f3 announced he had crossed into Colombia on foot to escape Maduro\u2019s \u201cpersecution\u201d and attend an international summit which Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, is hosting, in an effort to solve Venezuela\u2019s deeply entrenched political crisis.\n\nHowever, hours later Guaid\u00f3 was removed from the South American country by migration officials and boarded a plane to the US, where he landed early on Tuesday. \u201cUnfortunately, the persecution of the dictatorship spread to Colombia today,\u201d he said in a video statement filmed inside.\n\n\u201cGuaid\u00f3 didn\u2019t say it, but everything suggests he will not return to Venezuela,\u201d Luz Mely Reyes, a prominent Venezuelan journalist, tweeted as the politician touched down in Miami.\n\nChristopher Sabatini, a Latin America specialist from Chatham House in London, said Colombia\u2019s decision to send Guaid\u00f3 packing was a melancholy reflection of how dramatically his political standing had changed since early 2019, when he led huge protests through the streets of Caracas and enjoyed significant global support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sort of sad coda to his so-called presidency,\u201d said Sabatini, who said he suspected Guaid\u00f3\u2019s decision to travel to Colombia was a political stunt designed to reassert his waning authority over Venezuela\u2019s opposition.\n\nIn fact, Sabatini said he believed Guaid\u00f3\u2019s move \u2013 which he likened to a botched comeback attempt by the US actor Mickey Rourke \u2013 had merely highlighted his weakness. \u201cIt\u2019s pure performance. He\u2019s trying to make himself relevant again but it has the opposite effect. It makes him look sad.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that most of the governments that are attending [Petro\u2019s conference] \u2013 Spain, the UK, Chile and others \u2013 no longer recognize [Guaid\u00f3\u2019s] government, such as it was, or are now engaging with the Maduro government,\u201d Sabatini added.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s become a little bit of a caricature, to be honest. [He has] no real authority, not much popularity. He is clearly trying to grab headlines and make himself relevant and engaging.\u201d But this week\u2019s drama had merely \u201creinforced the sense of his irrelevance\u201d.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 continues to insist his crusade to bring political change to Venezuela is alive.\n\nBefore leaving the country, he had planned to take part in October opposition primaries designed to select a candidate to challenge Maduro in a presidential election scheduled for next year. That will be the first such vote since the 2018 election which Maduro won despite leading his country into one of the worst economic collapses outside a war zone in recent history. Much of the international community denounced the 2018 election as an undemocratic sham.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s party, Voluntad Popular (Popular Will), condemned what it called his \u201carbitrary expulsion\u201d from Colombia.\n\nHowever, Petro pushed back, claiming his country would have \u201cgladly\u201d offered Guaid\u00f3 asylum had he arrived at an official port of entry and presented a passport.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to enter the country illegally,\u201d Colombia\u2019s leftist president tweeted.\n\n\u201cClearly, a segment of politics wanted to disturb the unhindered progress of the international conference on Venezuela,\u201d Petro added.\n\nAt the opening of his one-day conference on Venezuela, Petro said he wanted to see steps to ensure its citizens were free to democratically elect their leaders. But Colombia\u2019s president also called for an end to US sanctions which he blamed for the dire humanitarian crisis that has forced more than seven million Venezuelans to flee abroad over the past eight years.\n\n\u201cWe have seen it on our streets\u200b: [Venezuelan] \u200bp\u200beople going hungry on the streets of Bogot\u00e1 and Colombia. People fleeing hunger, fleeing misery\u200b,\u201d Petro told diplomats from countries including the US, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, the UK and Brazil.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThe \u200bAmerica\u200bs\u200b cannot be a place of sanctions. \u200bThe Americas must be a place of freedoms. \u200bAnd the Americas must be a place of democrac\u200by.\u201d","35":"Pesticides banned in the EU because of their links to human health risks are being exported and used on farms in Brazil supplying Nestl\u00e9, an investigation has revealed.\n\nEurope is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable chemical companies, including the Swiss-based Syngenta and the German multinationals BASF and Bayer.\n\nBut a number of the pesticides and fungicides they produce have been banned by European health officials after they were linked to cancer, reproductive problems and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nDespite the ban, millions of pounds worth of the products are still being exported to Brazil, where they are used on farms that supply the international sugar market, according to a new investigation by Lighthouse Reports and Rep\u00f3rter Brasil.\n\nDocuments from the Brazilian agriculture ministry obtained through a freedom of information request reveal that a fungicide made by BASF and based on epoxiconazole, a chemical banned in the EU, was sprayed over two sugar plantations that supply Nestl\u00e9.\n\nOne of the farms using this banned fungicide is part of the giant Brazilian sugar corporation Copersucar, which sold \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m) of sugar to Europe in 2020.\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo state, Usina Atena, a Brazilian sugar plantation, is under investigation after a complaint from a neighbouring resident about the health impacts from the spraying of chemicals on the farm.\n\nJustice ministry officials in S\u00e3o Paulo found the farm had the Syngenta fungicide Priori Xtra. This contains the active substance cyproconazole, which is banned for use in the EU.\n\nThey also found the insecticide Regent 800WG, produced by BASF, and Certero, made by Bayer, which include the active ingredients fipronil and triflumuron. Both substances are banned in the EU.\n\nThe ECHA has classed epoxiconazole as a suspected carcinogen, and similar concerns were highlighted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n\nSugar at a Copersucar warehouse in Santos, Brazil. The company sold \u20ac1bn of sugar to Europe in 2020. Photograph: Patricia Monteiro\/Bloomberg\/Getty\n\nMarcos Orellana, UN special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, called the continued export of the chemicals by EU-based companies an \u201cabhorrent practice\u201d and urged the EU to implement a ban.\n\nCropLife International, which represents agri-chemical companies including BASF, Bayer and Syngenta, said the active ingredients in the pesticides had \u201cvalid use registrations in several OECD countries\u201d.\n\nIt said in a statement: \u201cA non-registration or deregistration in the European Union does not automatically mean a product cannot be used in another country. Pesticides are not automatically \u2018more hazardous\u2019 or \u2018less necessary\u2019 because they are not authorised in Europe.\u201d\n\nBayer and BASF maintain that all their products are safe for humans and the environment.\n\nCopersucar said it complied with Brazilian and international legislation, exporting its products within safety standards in the regions where it operates.\n\nA spokesperson for Nestl\u00e9 said all its suppliers must meet Nestl\u00e9\u2019s responsible sourcing standard, including in relation to good agricultural practices. \u201cWe continue to closely follow regulatory developments everywhere we operate to ensure full compliance for all our products. Nestl\u00e9 is not involved in campaigning against an export ban on pesticides and active ingredients banned in the EU.\u201d\n\n\n\nOfficials at DG Sante, the EU body responsible for regulating pesticides, said the export of banned pesticides would be phased out in line with the chemicals strategy for sustainability, although no timetable had been set for implementation.","36":"Haiti\u2019s tailspin into humanitarian crisis and bloodshed has racked up its latest moment of horror after at least a dozen suspected criminals were beaten to death and burned in broad daylight on the streets of its capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\nHorrifying footage of the incident showed the bloodied men being forced to lie on the asphalt by rifle-wielding police before bystanders piled tyres on top of them, doused them with petrol and set them alight.\n\nOne eyewitness told the Associated Press the lynch mob seized the victims from police after they were detained in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Canap\u00e9-Vert neighbourhood and proceeded to beat and stone them before burning their bodies.\n\nHundreds of onlookers flocked to the scene \u2013 where the news agency\u2019s reporter saw 13 burning bodies \u2013 to watch the nightmarish attack.\n\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, Haiti\u2019s national police said its officers had intercepted a group of suspected smugglers travelling in a minibus but that subsequently more than 12 of those men were \u201cunfortunately lynched by members of the population\u201d. An accompanying video showed the handguns and AK47 magazines police said had been seized with the victims.\n\nMonday\u2019s lynching came as Haiti\u2019s already dramatic social, political and humanitarian crisis intensified even further and the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said the security situation was \u201ccomparable to countries in armed conflict\u201d.\n\nIn just six days, between 14 and 19 April, nearly 70 people were killed in clashes involving gangs in Port-au-Prince\u2019s largest shantytown, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. About 40 of the dead were shot or stabbed. At least two were children.\n\n\u201cFighting is raging in Cit\u00e9 Soleil \u2026 The population feels under siege. They can no longer leave their homes for fear of gun violence and gang terror,\u201d the UN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator in Haiti, Ulrika Richardson, said in a statement.\n\nThat warning came a month after the UN called for the deployment of an international \u201cspecialised support force\u201d to Haiti after more than 530 people were killed in the opening weeks of this year, causing many clinics and schools to shut down. Between January and March the UN human rights office counted 531 killings, 300 injuries and 277 kidnappings in gang-related incidents, mostly in Haiti\u2019s gang-dominated capital.\n\nHaiti\u2019s desperate predicament is rooted in hundreds of years of foreign exploitation and meddling, decades of corrupt and dictatorial rule under the Duvalier dynasty, and a series of shattering natural disasters including a 2010 earthquake that levelled Haiti\u2019s capital and killed more than 200,000 people.\n\nBut the current crisis intensified in 2021 when Haiti\u2019s president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was assassinated in his Port-au-Prince mansion. Since then, politically powerful gangs have commandeered more than 60% of the capital, elements of the resource-starved police force have gone into open revolt, and Haitian politics has been consumed by infighting.\n\nAs of January, the country, which has been governed by former prime minister Ariel Henry since Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder, lacked a single democratically elected government official. It is unclear when a fresh presidential election will be held. The last one took place nearly seven years ago, in November 2016.\n\nLast month Haiti\u2019s Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported that the veteran British diplomat Jonathan Powell, who played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace talks which led to the 1998 Good Friday agreement, had become involved in efforts to break the political deadlock.\n\nJake Johnston, the author of a forthcoming book on Haiti called Aid State, said it was unclear what role Powell was playing but saw little prospect of a short-term solution. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a silver-bullet here. These are deeply rooted issues \u2026 and it takes time to change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have this sort of paralysis that has overtaken everything and in the meantime the government has largely abdicated and withdrawn,\u201d Johnston added. \u201cSo things are getting worse.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Guterres said he saw an \u201curgent need\u201d for an \u201cinternational specialised armed force\u201d to combat the violence. Kenya\u2019s foreign minister, Alfred Mutua, last week said his country was willing to send police officers \u201cto assist in stabilizing\u201d Haiti. However, as yet no country has stepped forward offering what would likely be a complex and violent mission.","37":"Mexican navy inspectors have intercepted 11,520 tequila bottles bound for export that actually contained nearly 10 tons of concentrated liquid meth.\n\nIn total, the bottles \u2013 intercepted over the weekend at the Pacific coast seaport of Manzanillo, contained approximately 8,640kgs (about 19,000lbs) of meth.\n\nPhotos of the seizure show a sniffer dog alerting inspectors to cardboard boxes of glass bottles full of a brownish liquid, consistent with the color of \u201ca\u00f1ejo\u201d or aged tequila. The labels on the bottles were not visible.\n\nMexico is the world\u2019s only producer of authentic tequila. While there have not been any reported instances of such bottles reaching consumers, ingesting the mixture would be immensely dangerous.\n\nMexico has become a major producer of meth and drug smugglers frequently are stopped at the border with liquid meth in their windshield washer fluid or other containers in their cars.\n\nThe liquid meth is usually recovered by the smugglers and taken to specialized facilities where the water is extracted and then returned to its usually crystal form.","38":"Grassroots activists who took on British mining giants and a serial plastics polluter \u2013 and won \u2013 are among this year\u2019s recipients of the world\u2019s most prestigious environmental prize.\n\nThe environmental campaigns led by the six 2023 Goldman prize winners highlight the hurdles faced by some local activists, who are often on the frontlines confronting the toxic mix of corporate greed and systemic corruption that is fuelling the climate emergency, biodiversity collapse and increasingly forced displacement.\n\nThe winners include the fourth-generation American fisher Diane Wilson, who won a landmark lawsuit against Formosa Plastics, one of the world\u2019s largest petrochemical companies, for dumping vast quantities of toxic plastic waste on the Texas Gulf coast.\n\nWilson, 74, collated insider information from more than 100 whistleblowers, becoming a self-trained private investigator and citizen scientist after state authorities let the Taiwanese multinational pollute with impunity for more than three decades.\n\n\u201cThe system is totally broken, there was no enforcement by our industry-friendly politicians while the company destroyed our fishing communities and the ecosystem. I am just a high school graduate, but feel a deep connection with the water and after 34 years of persistence we won, and it felt incredible,\u201d said Wilson, who helps oversee the 2019 court order to monitor and clean up the Texas wetlands and shoreline.\n\nThe $50m settlement is the largest award in a citizen-led suit against an industrial polluter in the history of the US Clean Water Act, and Formosa has since been forced to pay additional multimillion-dollar penalties for violating the new \u201czero-discharge\u201d rule.\n\nIn another David v Goliath legal victory, the African winner helped change UK law after the supreme court in London ruled that the British mining company Vedanta Resources could be tried in the UK court system, including on whether they owed a duty of care.\n\nChilekwa Mumba worked closely with villagers throughout the protracted legal battle during which he was publicly criticised and harassed for his activism. The villagers claimed their crops, livestock and only drinking water source were for years poisoned by pollution from a huge open-pit copper mine, and in 2021 Vedanta settled the claim without admission of liability.\n\n\u201cThe ruling gave the communities back hope that justice was possible, and are now even more motivated to protect their environment. This victory should have a ripple effect to companies who come to exploit resources in Africa and elsewhere, and force them to do business in a different way as they will be held responsible,\u201d said Mumba, 40, a business development consultant turned community organiser.\n\nThe 2021 legal precedent has been used to argue a duty of care by British companies across the supply chain, and has already been used to hold the fossil fuel giant Shell Global to account in the UK for pollution by its subsidiary in Nigeria.\n\nAcross the world, Indigenous and pastoral communities are on the frontline against unchecked urban development, industrial agriculture and polluting industries such as mining and fossil fuel projects.\n\nThis year\u2019s Goldman winners include Indigenous women from Indonesia and Brazil who overcame powerful corporations and deep-seated misogyny in their communities to safeguard large swaths of two of the world\u2019s largest rainforests.\n\nIn Brazil, Alessandra Korap Munduruku organised community efforts to stop the British mining company Anglo American from encroaching on Indigenous lands in the Amazon by exposing the corporations plotting to take advantage of former president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s rollback of environmental and Indigenous rights protections. In May 2021, Anglo American formally committed to withdraw 27 approved research applications to mine inside Indigenous territories, including 440,000 acres (178,000 hectares) of rainforest in Sawr\u00e9 Muybu lands which is home to Munduruku communities.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

But I was determined to do something to protect our land, rivers and forests from the invaders, and convinced the chiefs that women can be leaders in this ongoing struggle,\u201d said 33-year-old Korap.\n\nAs Korap helped coordinate national and international campaigns to name and shame the opaque mining deals, other multinationals also backed out and for the first time in decades, none of the 130 companies represented by the Brazilian Mining Association (Ibram) reported active mining applications in Indigenous territories.\n\nAmid record-breaking levels of violence and criminal persecution, the courage of environmental defenders like winner Delima Silalahi from North Sumatra is inspiring \u2013 and paramount to saving the planet from environmental collapse and climate chaos.\n\nIn 2022, Silalahi\u2019s campaign led to the Indonesian government awarding legal stewardship of 17,824 acres (7,200 hectares) of the over-exploited forest to six Indigenous communities with a history of forest stewardship. The new guardians have begun restoring the biodiverse tropical forest to create valuable carbon sinks; a safe habitat for endangered tiger, orangutan and rhino species; and a source of income through the sustainable cultivation of the native benzoin styrax trees for frankincense harvesting.\n\nNow in its 34th year, the prize has recognised 219 environmental leaders (121 men and 98 women) from 95 countries. And while many have gone on to hold leadership positions in government and non-profit organizations and as Nobel prize laureates, others have faced retaliation for their dogged campaigning, ending up arrested, jailed or dead.\n\nThe Indigenous leader from Honduras Berta C\u00e1ceres was assassinated in 2016, the year after being awarded the Goldman prize for leading a campaign to stop construction of an illegally sanctioned hydroelectric dam. The clean energy advocate Nguy Thi Khanh, the 2018 winner from Vietnam, is currently serving jail time for tax charges widely seen as bogus.\n\nThis year\u2019s other winners include Zafer Kizilkaya, whose innovative approach to marine conservation has helped turn Turkey into a role model for the Mediterranean, and Tero Mustonen, a fisher and climate scientist who helped transform dozens of severely degraded former industrial peat mining and forestry sites throughout Finland into carbon-absorbing biodiverse wetlands and habitats.","39":"Marine biologists at a Florida university say they have solved the mystery of a mass die-off of long-spined sea urchins from the US to the Caribbean.\n\nThe scientists blame a microscopic, single-cell parasite for the die-off, which took hold early last year. Affected Diadema antillarum urchins lose their spines and suction, then succumb to disease.\n\nThe researchers, from Tampa\u2019s University of South Florida (USF), also suspect the organism, a ciliate known as philaster, may have been responsible for wiping out about 98% of sea urchins in a similar episode in the region in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Yes, we have to figure this out,\u2019 because in that 80s die-out, just the loss of this one species of urchin completely changed the fate of coral reefs,\u201d Mya Breitbart, professor of biological oceanography at USF, told the Tampa Bay Times of the day she was invited to research the die-off in March last year.\n\nBreitbart and a team including scientists from Cornell University and the US Geological Survey cracked the case within four months. Their study was published last week in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances.\n\nThey identified the culprit by collecting samples from 23 sites around the Caribbean, including Aruba, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and observing organisms attached to the sea urchins, which are known as the \u201clawnmowers\u201d of coral reefs for their ability to consume decay-causing algae.\n\nThey were able to prove philaster was to blame by placing the organism in tanks with healthy, laboratory grown urchins and watching about 60% of the sample die with the same symptoms exhibited in the marine environment.\n\nBreitbart said what surprised them most was the speed at which they were able to home in on the prime suspect.\n\n\u201cAll of us on our team have been working on marine diseases for a long time, and this just doesn\u2019t happen. This is really unprecedented to figure it out,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cause of the 1980s die-off was not established at the time and may never be known, Breitbart said, because no samples from that outbreak still exist.\n\nBut the scientists did identify similarities between the two events, and say the outcome is the same: coral reefs clogged with algae and starved of nutrients, further adding to their precarious state.\n\nReefs in the Caribbean were already suffering from the fast-spreading and highly contagious stony coral tissue loss disease, scientists warning more than a decade ago that the entire reef system was in danger of collapse.\n\nWhile there is no known method to eliminate philaster or protect sea urchins from it, Breitbart said, she was hopeful that further research would provide a breakthrough. Her team in Tampa has established a laboratory farm to study the organism, which is not harmful to humans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to share this information with everyone, from reef managers to additional scientists so we can explore it further and try to stop its spread,\u201d she said.","40":"A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would destroy world trade, and distance would offer no protection to the inevitable catastrophic blow to the global economy, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, warned in a set piece speech on Britain\u2019s relations with Beijing.\n\nIn remarks that differ from French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempts to distance Europe from any potential US involvement in a future conflict over Taiwan, and which firmly support continued if guarded engagement with Beijing, Cleverly said \u201cno country could shield itself from the repercussions of a war in Taiwan\u201d.\n\nHe added that he shuddered to think of the financial and human ruin that would ensue.\n\nUrging no side to take unilateral action to change the status quo, he asserted the relevance of Taiwan to UK interests saying: \u201cAbout half of the world\u2019s container ships pass through these vital waters [the Taiwan Strait] every year, laden with goods bound for Europe and the far corners of the world. Taiwan is a thriving democracy and a crucial link in global supply chains, particularly for advanced semi-conductors.\n\n\u201cA war across the Strait would not only be a human tragedy, it would destroy world trade worth $2.6 trillion, according to Nikkei Asia. No country could shield itself from the repercussions.\n\n\u201cDistance would offer no protection from this catastrophic blow to the global economy \u2013 and to China most of all.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we watch new bases appearing in the South China Sea and beyond, we are bound to ask ourselves: what is it all for? Why is China making this colossal investment?\n\n\u201cIf we are left to draw our own conclusions, prudence dictates that we must assume the worst.\u201d\n\nOverall Cleverly set himself apart from advocates of economic decoupling including some of his own backbenchers saying he wanted Britain to \u201cengage directly with China, bilaterally and multilaterally, to preserve and create open, constructive and stable relations, reflecting China\u2019s global importance\u201d.\n\nAlthough he said the mass incarceration in Xinjiang cannot be ignored or brushed aside, he said: \u201cWe believe in a positive trade and investment relationship, whilst avoiding dependencies in critical supply chains.\n\n\u201cWe want British companies to do business in China \u2013 just as American, ASEAN, Australian and EU companies do \u2013 and we will support their efforts to make the terms work for both sides, pushing for a level playing field and fairer competition.\u201d\n\nChina he acknowledged represented a ruthlessly authoritarian tradition utterly at odds with Britain\u2019s own. \u201cBut we have an obligation to future generations to engage because otherwise we would be failing in our duty to sustain \u2013 and shape \u2013 the international order.

We will do more to safeguard academic freedom and research.\u201d He did not repeat the promise by Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, to close Chinese-controlled Confucius Institutes at British universities.\n\nHe also urged China in its relations with Russia over Ukraine not to allow Vladimir Putin to trample upon China\u2019s own stated principles of non-interference and respect for sovereignty.\n\nHe told China: \u201cA powerful and responsible nation cannot simply abstain when this happens, or draw closer to the aggressor, or aid and abet the aggression. The rights of a sovereign nation like Ukraine cannot be eradicated just because the eradicator enjoys a \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 with China.\u201d","41":"A Japanese startup attempting the first private landing on the moon has lost communication with its spacecraft and said that it assumes the lunar mission had failed.\n\nIspace said that it could not establish communication with the uncrewed Hakuto-R lunar lander after its expected landing time, a frustrating end to a mission that began with a launch from the US more than four months ago.\n\n\u201cWe have not confirmed communication with the lander,\u201d a company official told reporters about 25 minutes after the expected landing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have to assume that we could not complete the landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the official said.\n\nOfficials said they would continue to try and establish contact with the spacecraft, which was carrying payloads from several countries, including a lunar rover from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTakeshi Hakamada, the Ispace founder and CEO, said after the apparent failed landing that the company had acquired data from the spacecraft all the way up to the planned landing and would be examining that for signs of what happened.\n\nThe lander, standing just over 2 metres (6.5 feet) tall and weighing 340 kg, has been in lunar orbit since last month. Its descent and landing was fully automated and it was supposed to reestablish communication as soon as it touched down.\n\nSo far only the US, Russia and China have managed to put a spacecraft on the lunar surface, all through government-sponsored programmes.\n\nIn April 2019, Israeli organisation SpaceIL watched its lander crash into the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nIndia also attempted to land a spacecraft on the moon in 2019, but it crashed.\n\nTwo US companies, Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines, are scheduled to attempt moon landings later this year. \u201cWe congratulate the ispace inc team on accomplishing a significant number of milestones on their way to today\u2019s landing attempt,\u201d Astrobotic said in a tweet.\n\n\u201cWe hope everyone recognises \u2013 today is not the day to shy away from pursuing the lunar frontier, but a chance to learn from adversity and push forward.\u201d\n\nIspace, which listed its shares on the Tokyo stock exchange growth market earlier this month, was already planning its next mission before the failure of Hakuto-R.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are investigating the deaths of nine more people known to Sararath.\n\nSararath, who was arrested on Tuesday morning, has not commented publicly on the accusations. Her lawyer told the broadcaster Channel 3 that such allegations were serious, and that evidence must be seen.\n\nSurachate Hakparn, the assistant national police chief of the royal Thai police, said the accused was known to all of those who died, and that it was possible she had targeted them for financial reasons.\n\nSurachate said police had identified 11 victims in total, including one person who survived. The survivor had gone to eat food with the defendant, he said. \u201cThe victim vomited and fainted, but she survived,\u201d he said.\n\nSurachate said the defendant denied all the charges. Autopsies had been carried out on three of the bodies, he said.\n\nA report by Thai media said that items had been stolen from Siriporn, including two phones, two bags and money.\n\nRecovering evidence from previous deaths that were considered suspicious would be challenging, Surachate said. \u201cAs no case was filed [at the time of such deaths] there wasn\u2019t any investigation of crime scenes, or anything,\u201d he said.\n\nSurachate said police were not aware of any accomplice but that investigations would continue.

On a parallel track, a sleek Chinese bullet train is seen with just two drivers, looking surprised at the sight of the Indian train.\n\nAccording to United Nations projections published on Monday, India has a population of 1,425,775,850, surpassing China for the first time.\n\nKanchan Gupta, senior adviser to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, tweeted: \u201cHi Germany, this is outrageously racist. Der Spiegel caricaturing India in this manner has no resemblance to reality. Purpose is to show India down and suck up to China.\u201d\n\nRajeev Chandrasekhar, the minister for electronics and information technology, also reacted angrily, tweeting: \u201cDear Cartoonist at @derspiegel\u2026 Notwithstanding your attempt at mocking India \u2026 it\u2019s not smart to bet against India under PM @narendramodi ji\u2026. In a few years India\u2019s economy will be bigger than Germany\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSome Indians pointed out that it was true that during busy festivals when millions of Indians rush to go home, some trains do look like the one in the cartoon.\n\nWestern criticism has always rankled Indian governments but under Narendra Modi, the resentment is much sharper.\n\nAny negative coverage, such as the recent BBC documentary, India: The Modi Question, which examined the prime minister\u2019s role in the 2002 anti-Muslim riots, is routinely dismissed as a malicious conspiracy to defame Modi and, by association, India.\n\nIn 2021, Modi himself made the same claim during an election rally in Assam, complaining that Indian tea and yoga were being maligned by foreigners.\n\n\u201cThese days there are conspiracies against the nation. They are trying to malign the image of Indian tea worldwide. Some documents have revealed that such conspiracy is being hatched by forces sitting in a foreign land,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, Baijayant Panda, an MP and spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, wrote a column in the Hindustan Times accusing the western media of outright prejudice against India.\n\nPanda accused the media of ignoring India\u2019s progress and, without naming it, singled out the New York Times for what he called its bias and routine India-bashing. He added: \u201cWhat is peculiar is the abandonment of objectivity in the single-minded pursuit of a predetermined narrative.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the New York Times published a cartoon mocking India\u2019s feat in putting a robotic probe into orbit around Mars. It showed an Indian farmer with a cow knocking at the door of a room marked Elite Space Club. After protests, the newspaper published an apology.","44":"A Chinese journalist at one of the country\u2019s major state media outlets known for his relatively forthright and liberal writings has been arrested on charges of espionage, his family have said.\n\nDong Yuyu was detained in February 2022 after meeting with a Japanese diplomat who, it was reported at the time, was also taken for interrogation before being released. Dong\u2019s family kept his detention secret in the hope of securing his release, but last month were told his case was progressing to trial.\n\nUnder China\u2019s espionage laws \u2013 which are set to be broadened even further on Wednesday \u2013 Dong could face a jail sentence of 10 years to life. China\u2019s notoriously opaque justice system has a conviction rate of more than 99%, with next to no transparency for national security-related cases.\n\n\u201cPeople tried for espionage in China are almost always convicted, with the typical sentence being 10 years,\u201d said a statement from the leaders of the US National Press Club. \u201cYuyu has not seen his family since he was detained and has been allowed to meet his lawyer in person only one time.\u201d\n\nYuyu\u2019s detention has been widely criticised by human rights and press freedom groups, as well as Harvard University\u2019s Niemen Foundation where Dong was a fellow in 2007.\n\nCritics say the editor appears to have been targeted over his connections and \u201cnormal interactions\u201d with foreigners. Dong was well known among international circles in Beijing, and among western journalists and diplomats.\n\n\u201c[The family\u2019s] hope was that investigators could understand that his foreign ties were not suspicious but a normal part of his job and a normal interaction between peoples in most parts of the world,\u201d said his family\u2019s statement, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDong had worked at the Guangming Daily, one of China\u2019s major state-controlled newspapers, since 1987. He had completed fellowships in Japan and the US, and written for the New York Times. Through a long career, his writings have been described as being pro-reform, with liberal advocacy for improvement of Chinese governance.\n\nHis prosecution has prompted warnings over the Chinese government\u2019s growing hostility towards interactions between Chinese and foreigners amid rising nationalistic sentiment and government suspicion of foreign \u201cinterference\u201d. Relations with the US and Japan in particular are at a low point, exacerbated by tensions over Taiwan.\n\nAn open letter signed by more than 60 academics and journalists, many of whom had met with Dong over the years, called for the journalist\u2019s release and said the case meant acts of \u201cpeople to people diplomacy\u201d, for which the Chinese government professes support, could not happen if Chinese counterparts risked being accused of espionage.\n\n\u201cMeetings with people like Mr Dong are essential if China and the rest of the world are to have productive, open, and stable relations,\u201d it said.\n\nThe growing authoritarianism of China\u2019s ruling Communist party has brought a far more dangerous environment for liberal thinkers, lawyers, and civil society workers. On Wednesday, China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament is expected to pass amendments to the country\u2019s espionage laws, broadening their scope and increasing search powers of authorities.\n\nJournalists, activists and lawyers have been detained, harassed, and jailed. On Tuesday, Chinese state media revealed a Taiwanese political activist, arrested in August, had been formally charged with secession offences. Yang Chih-yuan is the vice-chair of the Taiwanese National party, and had advocated for an independent state of Taiwan. Beijing claims Taiwan as a wayward province of China that it intends to \u201creunify\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s democratically elected government and people oppose Chinese rule.\n\nAlso this week, Chinese authorities arrested a Taiwan-based bookseller who had returned to Shanghai to renounce his citizenship as part of his Taiwanese naturalisation. Earlier this month, two prominent human rights activists were given extraordinarily long jail sentences of 12 and 14 years.\n\nIn recent years, Chinese authorities have arrested Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist working for Chinese state media who remains detained, and a Bloomberg news assistant, Haze Fan, who was released last year. Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer and citizen journalist, was in 2020 sentenced to four years in jail for her reports from Wuhan during the early pandemic lockdown. She was among several citizen journalists who disappeared while reporting from Wuhan.\n\nIris Hsu, China representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said prosecuting Dong for espionage was \u201cabsurd and cruel\u201d. \u201cSpeaking to foreign diplomats is crucial to journalists covering international news,\u201d Hsu said.\n\nThe CPJ noted that China was the second-worst jailer of journalists in the world, with at least 48 behind bars as of 1 December 2022. It said Dong was not included in that figure because they were unaware of his detention at the time. Surveys by Reporters Without Borders have in recent years put the figure above 100.\n\nAdditional research by Chi Hui Lin","45":"Hong Kong schools are being forced to merge or prepare for closure as a decade-long decline in the birthrate and a recent exodus of residents from the city has led to a plunge in student numbers.\n\nLocal media have reported that at least five schools face closure in coming years after they failed to reach the minimum 16 enrolments in the first grade. There have been two recent cases of schools merging with each other due to insufficient student numbers.\n\nThe secretary of the city\u2019s education department, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, on Saturday flagged that \u201cmaybe there are some others coming\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are still communicating with different school sponsoring bodies,\u201d said Choi.\n\nEducation department data shows a steady decline in kindergarten student numbers since 2015, from about 185,000 down to almost 156,000 in 2021\/22. Primary school enrolments also dropped, from 373,000 in 2019\/20 to 364,000 in 2020\/21, and to about 349,000 the next year.\n\nIn March, the private Tak Nga Primary School told parents it would stop teaching Primary One classes from 2024-25 and would close completely in 2028, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\n\u201cSince 2018, the school has failed to admit sufficient pupils because of the falling birth rate in Hong Kong, and the problem is further aggravated by the emigration wave in recent years,\u201d the school\u2019s funding body reportedly said in a letter to parents.\n\nIn April, the South China Morning Post reported that four international education organisations had been warned they faced termination of their operating agreements after they failed to enrol the minimum 70% non-local students, some for a second year.\n\nOn Tuesday the paper \u2013 citing anonymous principles \u2013 reported five schools across Hong Kong were now facing closure.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s birthrate is one of the lowest in the world, and like several countries across east Asia is facing the demographic crisis of an ageing population. Apart from an increase measured from 2003 to 2011, the live birthrate has steadily fallen from 35 per 1,000 population in 1961 down to 5.2 per 1,000 population in 2021. Government efforts, including financial inducements and tax relief, have failed to turn the rate around.\n\nThe issue has been exacerbated by an exodus of residents and expats from Hong Kong, driven by the pandemic, and the government\u2019s crackdown on dissent and political freedom.\n\nOne person working in the education sector said that because teachers were among the people leaving, the pending closures were perhaps not having a huge impact on the overall number of teaching jobs available, but there were concerns that there would not be enough qualified teachers for secondary classes, which will be the last to shrink.\n\nAlmost 12,000 teachers have resigned from Hong Kong schools since 2021, according to the education department.\n\nAdditional research by Chi Hui Lin","46":"Taking questions, Butler is pushing back against what he calls the pharmacy lobby\u2019s \u201cscare campaigns\u201d that suggest his new policy could worsen medicine shortages.\n\nReporter:\n\nThe Pharmacy Guild is saying of the 300 medicines that are part of the changes, about 40% have shortages at the moment , and it is all well and good to double the amount of prescriptions for patients but double of nothing is still nothing. What is being done to ensure that these medicines that are part of the changes have adequate supplies and also particularly for regional and rural pharmacies where their supplies might not be as much as the city counterparts?\n\nButler:\n\nFirstly, I advise people to take advice around medicine supply and shortages from our medicines authorities rather than the pharmacy lobby group. The actual truth is of the 325 medicines that I have announced today, only seven of them are experiencing supply shortages. Shortages which are reflected across the world and are a product of the impact of Covid supply lines.\n\nThis is not going to change the number of tablets dispensed in a given period of time. It is simply going to mean that people can get two boxes at a time, instead of having to get one box and come back twice as often. We have very strong arrangements for supply from wholesalers in this country, wholesalers are funded by taxpayers to ensure that any pharmacist that is dealing with supply shortages will have that supply delivered within 24 hours anywhere in this country, whether you are a pharmacy in the city or a pharmacy in regional and rural Australia.\n\nI would caution against some of the scare campaigns being put by the pharmacy lobby group.","47":"The yes campaign for the Indigenous voice to parliament will seek to persuade Australians that the referendum is a simple choice about constitutional recognition, with a new national ad campaign looking to reset a debate that has been dominated by dense legal arguments and political fights.\n\nThe yes campaign alliance director, Dean Parkin, says the advertising blitz, beginning on Wednesday and titled \u201cJoin Us\u201d, is a \u201crallying call\u201d for Australians to back the campaign for constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a voice to parliament.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been lots of political and legal discussion about the voice, the constitution and recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, that\u2019s left people behind and become a Canberra-centric conversation.\n\n\u201cThat process has had its turn. It\u2019s now time to focus on where this referendum is really important, which is about people across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Yes 23 campaign will launch its first national advertisements this week, featuring Indigenous community figures from urban and rural Australia.\n\nParkin describes the campaign \u2013 which will roll out through TV, online, billboard and bus shelter platforms \u2013 as having a \u201csimple\u201d message, that constitutional recognition of Indigenous people is overdue.\n\nThe campaign is narrated by the Gadigal elder Uncle Allen Madden, of the Sydney Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. It features the Arrernte elder Aunty Sabella Turner, a leading figure in Alice Springs\u2019 Aboriginal health sector and a cultural lead at the Central Aboriginal Congress, and the Awabakal man John \u201cChoc\u201d Anderson.\n\nThe commercial was also developed with the Kaytetye man Dylan River and the Quandamooka man and playwright Wesley Enoch.\n\n\u201cPeople from the desert, country and the cities have a similar goal with local differences,\u201d River said of the referendum. \u201cConstitutional recognition through a voice to parliament that will give them a say will support better outcomes on the ground, in communities, where it matters.\u201d\n\nParkin said the ad would be the first step in the major public campaign from the yes alliance, which includes civil society groups, charities, trade unions and sporting organisations. He said it was a \u201cstarting point\u201d to \u201cinvite people in\u201d, acknowledging much of the conversation about the referendum had so far focused on politicians and lawyers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really keen to have a very straightforward, simple conversation with the people,\u201d Parkin said.\n\n\u201cThe political conversation, it hasn\u2019t had a lot of participants. It\u2019s been legal experts, commentators, but when you get out on the ground and have a conversation, it\u2019s a totally different conversation. It\u2019s in a different place, there\u2019s a level of goodwill here that\u2019s lacking in the political conversations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s goodwill, curiosity, interest in what this is all about. There is a level for fairness in people, saying, \u2018Of course recognition makes sense.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou get a sense from people that they think it feels right.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the alliance had more than 5,000 volunteers, either directly engaged with the campaign or its partners and noted it had launched an online shop and donations portal.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about one person or one organisation or one community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe yes campaign, the very model is an alliance based model; supportive organisations getting onboard, doing the hard yards, engaging their communities.\n\n\u201cOur movement is one of many people, many voices, which is representative of the support for a successful yes vote.\u201d\n\nParkin said the yes side would soon showcase \u201cmore diverse voices engaging in the media\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere will be further campaign events, we\u2019ll get a wide range of people involved,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the political and legal conversation intensely for the last few months, we\u2019re now going direct to the people.\u201d","48":"Labor backbenchers have joined hundreds of politicians, academics, business leaders and advocates in calling for the Albanese government to substantially increase the jobseeker rate.\n\nThe MPs Alicia Payne, Michelle Ananda-Rajah, Kate Thwaites and Louise Miller-Frost have added their names to an open letter calling on their party leader, Anthony Albanese, to stop leaving \u201cpeople with the least behind\u201d.\n\nIn a sign of growing discontent in the Labor caucus, MPs Mike Freelander and Carina Garland also called for an increase jobseeker on Wednesday.\n\nAlbanese went to the election promising \u201cno one held back, no one left behind\u201d.\n\nThe signatories to the open letter, which was co-organised by the Australian Council of Social Service and includes the support of the Liberal MP Bridget Archer, teal independents and members of the Senate crossbench say it\u2019s time Labor fulfilled its vow and addressed the \u201cincreased deprivation\u201d faced by welfare recipients.\n\n\u201cThe rate of income support is so low that people are being forced to choose between paying their rent or buying enough food and medicine,\u201d the letter to the prime minister reads.\n\n\u201cAs a result, people experience chronic mental and physical health issues, they\u2019re forced into homelessness and insecure housing, trapped with abusive partners, and locked out of paid work because they don\u2019t have the money they need to retrain and re-enter the workforce.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s economic inclusion advisory committee proposed lifting the jobseeker rate to 90% of the aged pension, which would mean an additional $90 a week for participants. It found the current rate was so low it was a barrier to finding work, with jobseekers unable to afford \u201cthe essentials of life\u201d.\n\nAlmost as soon as the report became public last week, the government ruled out any substantial increase to the unemployment benefit, citing budget pressures.\n\nBut economists, First Nations leaders, academics and business and community leaders, including the chair of the economic inclusion advisory panel, the former Gillard government minister Jenny Macklin, said the jobseeker rate was a \u201cstructural injustice\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, Freelander said he \u201chad a longstanding belief we need to bring people into society because at the present time jobseeker isolates them\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to live on, certainly not in Sydney,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve previously said that stage three tax cuts should stay because we campaigned on keeping them. But if there\u2019s no other way, I\u2019d rather they go and we increase jobseeker. Clearly people are quite desperate at the moment.\u201d\n\nGarland, the member for Chisholm, said: \u201cI do want us to do more to support people who need support.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Increasing numbers of jobseeker recipients have chronic illness or disabilities which make full-time work impossible but are unable to meet the disability support pension\u2019s strict criteria.\n\nThe majority of people living on the unemployment or parenting payments are in poverty, including 761,000 children. That number is thought to have increased as the cost-of-living crisis, compounded by a housing affordability crisis, continues to bite.\n\nAustralians trying to live on welfare were temporarily lifted out of poverty at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when the Morrison government doubled the rate of jobseeker as a safety net for people who lost their job due to the lockdowns.\n\nBut the Covid subsidy was later cancelled. While the Albanese government has offered some hope it plans to raise the threshold when the single parenting payment stops, it is yet to make any commitment to increasing the unemployment payment.\n\nOn Wednesday, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, rebuffed calls for a jobseeker increasing, arguing \u201cwe\u2019re not able to fund every single good idea\u201d.\n\nThe environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, suggested the government would make \u201ca lot more announcements about how we look after the most vulnerable Australians\u201d before and in the budget.\n\nPlibersek told ABC News Breakfast at a time \u201cwhen unemployment is relatively low, this is the time to invest to make sure that people have the opportunity to move particularly from long term unemployment into employment\u201d.","49":"Wearing a helmet or soft headgear does not protect against concussions, according to experts who are calling for greater public awareness around the issue.\n\nIt comes ahead of a public hearing of the Senate inquiry into concussions and repeated head trauma in contact sports, to be held in Melbourne on Wednesday.\n\nRepeated studies have shown that headgear being able to protect players from concussions in contact sport is a myth.\n\nAs far back as 2005, a study of 304 rugby union players in New Zealand found \u201cthe risk of concussion was not lessened by the use of padded headgear or mouthguards\u201d.\n\nResearch into padded headgear in 400 junior AFL players, published last April, found that \u201cheadgear use was not associated with reduced risk of suspected sports-related concussion\u201d.\n\nThe findings, according to a review, correspond to lab testing which has suggested that padded headgear is \u201cunable to absorb additional force well below the threshold at which concussions occur\u201d.\n\nNeither are hard helmets, such as those worn by American football players, protective against concussion.\n\n\u201cA helmet can protect the skull bone from fracturing,\u201d said Prof Alan Pearce, a neurophysiologist and concussion researcher at La Trobe University. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t stop the brain tissue from moving inside the skull \u2013 and that\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\nThe brain is suspended in a bath of clear fluid known as cerebrospinal fluid. It acts, to a certain extent, as a shock absorber.\n\nConcussions occur when external forces act upon the brain, resulting in it moving inside the skull cavity and either directly hitting the inside of the skull or stretching and twisting.\n\nPearce, who will testify at the Senate hearing, likens the consistency of the brain to congealed jelly. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of solid but you could squeeze your brain through your fingers, that\u2019s how delicate the tissue is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at 120kg blokes hitting each other at 35km per hour, the cerebrospinal fluid doesn\u2019t actually protect the brain, it makes it more likely that the brain will move in the skull.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re getting exposed to multiple repetitive impacts over a playing career increases the risk of CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy] developing.\n\n\u201cHelmets are not going to protect against these micro impacts \u2013 we\u2019re talking about 20, 30, 40,000 impacts over a career.\u201d\n\nSome manufacturers have developed newer helmet designs which purport to reduce the forces acting on the brain, but there is still no strong evidence to support their efficacy.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you\u2019re thinking about things like a car accident, if you move the head fast enough it will cause the stretching.\n\n\u201cHeadgear, unfortunately, isn\u2019t going to do anything about the movement of the brain.\u201d\n\nLast month, some Sydney junior rugby league clubs announced they would issue free headgear to children as an incentive for \u201ctackle-happy kids\u201d. The president of the Sydney eastern suburbs district junior rugby league, Bob Tate, claimed to the Daily Telegraph that headgear amounted to \u201can extra layer of protection that might make the game a little bit safer for their little ones\u201d.\n\nBut experts say the best way of making young players safer is to modify sports in childhood to be non-contact.\n\n\u201c[CTE] is a preventable environmental disease of exposure,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cThe answer is actually reducing exposure. So don\u2019t just pad our kids up in helmets and whatnot \u2013 let\u2019s actually modify the sports until the age of 14 to reduce that exposure for the first say, eight or nine years.\u201d\n\nCorrigan agreed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that kids shouldn\u2019t be involved in sport, but it\u2019s just being mindful about modifying \u2026 that involvement.\u201d\n\nShe refuted the idea \u201cthat if you put someone in soft headgear that that means that they will be protected\u201d.\n\n\u201cObviously there are better ways to manage the risk, in terms of modifying the game \u2026 to try and decrease the risk of the head injury occurring in the first place,\u201d she said.","50":"New South Wales residents lost $4.3bn to poker machines in six months last year \u2013 $820m more than the total losses recorded in a similar period before the pandemic.\n\nData released this week by the gaming regulator found that while the state\u2019s politicians were debating how to reform the sector in the last six months of 2022, punters were pouring billions into machines. The Liquor and Gaming NSW data covers machine profits in clubs from June to November 2022 and in pubs from July to December 2022.\n\nMore than 220 new machines were installed across venues in the six-month period, taking the state total to 86,872. Total gaming machine net profits jumped 11% to $4.26bn \u2013 24% higher than the $3.44bn reached in the last six months of 2019.\n\nFairfield, in Sydney\u2019s west, remains the local government area with the highest net profit for poker machines in clubs, raking in $225m over the six months. Canterbury-Bankstown followed close behind with $204m, ahead of Cumberland bringing in $133m.\n\nThe report found the 615 machines at the Mounties social club at Mount Prichard were the most profitable in the state, followed by 450 machines at Cabra-Vale ex-active servicemen\u2019s club at Canley Vale. Both are located in Fairfield.\n\nThe figures reveal there had been a sharp rise in gaming profits since before the pandemic and a drastic uplift in gaming profits of 120% since the same time in 2021, when Sydney was in lockdown. Liquor and Gambling NSW attribute the rises in part to patrons heading back to pubs and clubs, as well as machines that were offline during the pandemic being switched back on.\n\nProfits in pubs jumped by more than $400m over the period, while club profits rose $300m.\n\nThe state was on the verge of major gaming reform when Dominic Perrottet was voted out of power in March. He had joined forces with members of the crossbench, including the independent Sydney MP, Alex Greenwich, vowing to introduce cashless gambling systems to reduce problem gambling and criminal activity with the clubs.\n\nThe $344m plan would have seen legislation introduced to ensure a staged transition to universal cashless gaming between 2024 and 2028.\n\n\u201cIt will save lives,\u201d Perrottet said at the time. \u201cIt will protect jobs and ensure that our communities across NSW are stronger now and into the future.\u201d\n\nLabor took a softer policy to the election that was widely condemned by critics, who accused the party of failing to capitalise on what could have been a bipartisan effort to tackle the scourge.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The deal was renewed last month for 60 days, but Russia has signalled it may not agree to extend it further unless the west removes obstacles to the exports of Russian grain and fertiliser. Lavrov made his comments during a news conference at the United Nations.\n\nUpdated at 18.44 BST\n\n7h ago 18.33 BST A Russian tennis player was refused boarding to a flight operated by the Polish airline Lot, the company confirmed on Tuesday, in an incident that drew an angry response from the athlete on social media. Vitalia Diatchenko said on Monday she was refused boarding to a Lot flight in Cairo, with the German airline Lufthansa then also refusing to sell her a ticket, Reuters reports. The 32-year-old said she had been attempting to travel to a tournament in Corsica via Warsaw and Nice. She wrote: I slept at the airport, I was treated like a third-class citizen (because of my nationality), spent a few thousand euro. In an emailed statement, Lot confirmed it had not allowed the player to board, citing restrictions introduced by Poland\u2019s interior ministry as a result of the Covid pandemic and updated in 2022 after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Lot said: The provisions of the regulation introduce restrictions at certain border crossings, including airport crossings, in relation to citizens of the Russian Federation travelling from outside the Schengen area. The European Union has banned all flights from Russia and has agreed to limit issuing free-travel Schengen zone visas. In September, Finland joined the Baltic states and Poland in closing its borders to Russian tourists. Diatchenko, who is ranked 250th in the world by the Women\u2019s Tennis Association, said that when she tried to buy a ticket with Lufthansa she was told she could only enter the Schengen zone via Spain because it had issued her visa. Lufthansa made no immediate comment. Unlike many other sports, tennis did not introduce a blanket ban on players from Russia and its ally Belarus after the invasion of Ukraine. Wimbledon banned players from the two countries last year after the invasion, but said in March it would now accept them as neutral athletes. Russian and Belarusian players have been competing on the tours and at the other grand slams as neutral athletes.\n\nUpdated at 18.41 BST\n\n7h ago 18.15 BST Russian human rights groups have filed complaints seeking to repeal a law that bans people from speaking out against the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Sky News reports.

Since September, Pernod Ricard has exported spirits to Russia \u2013 including Beefeater Gin and Jameson whiskey \u2013 amounting to tens of millions of dollars, according to Ukraine Solidarity Project, a non-government network of international and Ukrainian citizens. According to the group, Pernod Ricard ceased exporting Absolut vodka to Russia in April 2023. However, they allege the firm did not stop the sale of its other brands to Russia. A campaign sign in central London. Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska for Ukraine Solidarity Project\/Shutterstock Nick Martlew, the UK director of Ukraine Solidarity Project, said: Until Pernod Ricard does the right thing and stops serving Putin, we\u2019re calling for a boycott of Beefeater and their other brands, in solidarity with the brave Ukrainians who are risking their lives to fight off Russian invaders. The company is trying to sneak this iconic British brand back on to the shelves in Putin\u2019s Russia, and in doing so is supporting his brutal war against Ukraine. It\u2019s so grubby. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for Pernod Ricard told the Guardian they \u201cimmediately and continue to\u201d condemn the unjustifiable war and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In Russia, the spokesperson said the firm has stopped marketing investments, and reduced the number of imported brands and quantities sold, in addition to limited importation of some brands. \u201cMany companies, in our industry and in others, have made the same choice to maintain a limited presence in the market,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nUpdated at 17.45 BST\n\n9h ago 16.21 BST Two German companies that between them build the Leopard 2 \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most advanced battle tanks \u2013 have become embroiled in a legal spat over its intellectual property rights, even as they ride a defence boom due to the war in Ukraine. Rheinmetall AG, which was thrust into the spotlight last year as Germany ramped up its defence spending, is being taken to court by its peer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), with a hearing due at a Munich court on 2 May. Bowing to pressure from allies, Germany\u2019s government this year agreed to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, one of the big ticket items sought by Kyiv as it gears up to mount a counteroffensive against Russian forces. Duesseldorf-based Rheinmetall makes the cannon of the Leopard 2, while the Munich-based KMW makes its chassis. But KMW has objected to statements made by Rheinmetall\u2019s chief executive, Armin Papperger, in a newspaper interview with the Neue Zuercher Zeitung in March, in which he was quoted as saying that Rheinmetall owned the rights to the Leopard 2A4 model. A district court in Munich said in a statement on Tuesday that KMW was seeking legal protection to prevent Rheinmetall from making statements it considered to be \u201cuntrue, misleading factual assertions that violate its rights\u201d. KMW and Rheinmetall declined comment. It was not immediately clear what impact, if any, the dispute may have on cooperation between the two companies, who last week jointly announced an order from the German army to upgrade 143 Puma fighting vehicles. The order is valued at about 770 million euros ($845m).\n\nUpdated at 17.15 BST\n\n10h ago 15.54 BST South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said his ruling ANC party has resolved to quit the international criminal court, which last month issued an arrest warrant against Putin. The ICC issued an arrest warrant against Putin in March, meaning Pretoria, which is due to host the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa bloc summit this year, would be required to detain him on arrival. \u201cYes, the governing party \u2026 has taken that decision that it is prudent that South Africa should pull out of the ICC,\u201d Ramaphosa said during a press conference co-hosted with the visiting president of Finland, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, AFP reports. Ramaphosa said the decision, which follows a weekend meeting of the African National Congress (ANC), was reached \u201clargely\u201d because of the court\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of certain countries. He said: We would like this matter of unfair treatment to be properly discussed, but in the meantime the governing party has decided once again that there should be a pull out. The arrest warrant against Putin followed accusations that the Kremlin unlawfully deported Ukrainian children. On whether South Africa would arrest Putin, Ramaphosa said \u201cthat matter is under consideration\u201d. But his party\u2019s secretary general, Fikile Mbalula, earlier declared that \u201cPutin can come any time in this country\u201d.

Under Musk\u2019s ownership Twitter has reduced its workforce from 7,500 people to about 1,500, leading to fears that moderation standards and its ability to comply with the act would suffer as a consequence.\n\nIn November last year, the EU\u2019s commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, implied that Twitter was in danger of non-compliance with the act, telling Musk that the company will have to raise its efforts to \u201cpass the grade\u201d. Breton added that Musk had \u201chuge work ahead\u201d to comply with the DSA. However, a readout of the November meeting with Musk added that the Tesla CEO had \u201ccommitted to comply\u201d with the DSA.\n\nIn January, Breton again urged Musk to \u201cprogress towards full compliance with the DSA\u201d, with Musk replying that the DSA\u2019s goals of transparency, accountability and accurate information were aligned with Twitter\u2019s.\n\nUnder the rules for large platforms, they must carry out annual risk assessments outlining the risks of harmful content such as disinformation, misogyny, harms to children and election manipulation. The moderation systems and measures put in place to mitigate those risks will also be checked by the EU.\n\nThe big platforms will also have to publish an independent audit of their compliance with the DSA, as well as how many people they employ in content moderation. They must also provide details of their algorithms and allow independent researchers to monitor compliance with the act.\n\nPlatforms will also be banned from building profiles of child users for companies to target them with ads. Those platforms that can be reached by minors must also put in place measures to protect their privacy and keep them safe. Users must also be able to report illegal content easily.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, confirmed Twitter\u2019s designation as a VLOP on Tuesday, while Google and Microsoft\u2019s Bing will also have to comply with similarly strict regulations after being designated \u201cvery large search engines\u201d. Tech platforms must reach at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU in order to be designated VLOPs or VLSEs.\n\nThere are also regulations for smaller platforms such as publishing transparent terms and conditions.\n\nBreton said on Tuesday the \u201ccountdown is starting\u201d for the companies designated with special status under the act. \u201cToday is the D(SA)-Day for digital regulation,\u201d he said.\n\nGuillaume Couneson, a partner at law firm Linklaters, said complying with the VLOP and VLSE provisions was a \u201cchallenge for everyone\u201d and not just Twitter. The designated companies now have four months to comply with the act\u2019s obligations including the first annual risk assessment.\n\n\u201cIt is not a long period of time to implement strict and in some cases burdensome obligations,\u201d said Couneson.","55":"Italy\u2019s tourism ministry has faced ridicule after an official video to attract tourists to Italy used footage of people in Slovenia drinking Slovenian wine.\n\nThe video, part of a \u20ac9m ($9.91m) campaign produced by the Armando Testa communications group, was widely mocked by critics and on social media even before it emerged that part of it had been shot abroad.\n\nTitled \u201cOpen to Meraviglia\u201d (Open to Wonder), the video features a computerised \u201cinfluencer\u201d version of Venus, a symbol of Italian art, as depicted by Sandro Botticelli in his renaissance masterpiece The Birth of Venus.\n\nThe very modern \u201cVenus\u201d dons a mini-skirt and is shown eating pizza and presenting some of Italy\u2019s main tourist attractions such as the Coliseum in Rome or Florence\u2019s cathedral.\n\nThe art historian Tomaso Montanari called the advertising campaign \u201cgrotesque\u201d, and an \u201cobscene\u201d waste of money, while the video was lampooned by users of Italian social media platforms.\n\nThe most controversial footage shows a group of young people smiling on a sunlit patio drinking wine in what is presented as a typical Italian scene. However, eagle-eyed viewers spotted that the patio in question is actually in the Cotar region of Slovenia, close to the Italian border, and the bottle on the table has a Cotar wine label.\n\nThe Armando Testa communications group was not immediately available to comment.\n\nThe Italian tourism minister, Daniela Santanche, a member of prime minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s far-right Brothers of Italy party, called critics of the video \u201csnobs\u201d and said the depiction of Venus as an influencer was aimed at attracting young people.","56":"A plan to ban up to 7,000 of the most potentially dangerous chemicals on the European market by 2030 is failing badly, according to a study.\n\nA year ago, the EU launched a roadmap to banning groups of toxic substances linked to environmental damage and serious illnesses such as cancers, hormonal disruption and reprotoxic disorders. These included all bisphenols, the most dangerous flame retardants, and the increasingly controversial PFAS chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).\n\nAlso known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, PFAS formulations accumulate in the natural environment where they take hundreds of years \u2013 or longer \u2013 to degrade. They were used so ubiquitously over the last century that one US government study found them in the bloodstreams of almost all Americans, while a survey this year logged 17,000 contaminated sites in Europe - and 2,100 hotspots.\n\nThe restrictions roadmap was brought in as an interim measure to protect the public and nature while the European Commission finalises an update to its complex Reach programme (which centrally compiles data on modern synthetic chemicals, and sets rules for their governance).\n\nBut Reach has been delayed and the commission has so far used the roadmap to implement bans on just 14 chemical groups, of which only two appear watertight, according to a joint report by the green law group ClientEarth and the European Environmental Bureau.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duguy, ClientEarth\u2019s law and policy adviser, said lagging action showed \u201cthe failure of the EU\u2019s piecemeal approach to chemical bans. This approach means that people and our environment are not protected against the most harmful chemicals. This needs to change now. European authorities and the EU commission have all legal tools to rescue this roadmap and correct a depressing direction of travel.\u201d\n\nA revised Reach regulation is still due by the end of the year, while the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) raised the prospect of new regulation of bisphenol A in food last week. Efsa reduced its tolerable daily intake recommendation of the substance by a factor of 20,000, due to the risk of allergic lung inflammation and autoimmune disorders.\n\nHowever, most uses of bisphenols look set to continue, with only five of the 148 bisphenols on the market facing restrictions. Campaigners also expect no let-up in contamination from toxic lead shot across Europe, because of a loophole in a commission proposal that allows its continued use for sport.\n\nA possible ban on single-use nappies that contain dioxins, furans, formaldehyde and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was also withdrawn.\n\nHeather Kiggins, a spokesperson for Cefic, the European chemicals industry trade association, said: \u201cOne has to have patience while assessing the progress of [an] initiative of such magnitude. We believe we need to give it at least five years. There is a well-known regulatory process to follow, with ECHA committees involved. The conclusions on lead in ammunition, baby nappies and others follow the process and we respect the process.\u201d\n\nHowever, the study claims that slow progress on chemical files has created de facto \u201cregulatory holidays\u201d with legal deadlines broken in almost all cases and multi-year exemptions for non-critical uses of dangerous substances.\n\nProposals to restrict PFAS used in skin-sensitising substances have gathered dust for two and a half years, as has a planned restriction on the use of calcium cyanamide in fertiliser, it says. Limits on the use of intentionally added microplastics have been discussed for more than a year in Brussels, while 42,000 tons of the substance continues to wash through Europe\u2019s rivers and seas annually.\n\nThe study blames a lack of resources made available to officials working on these files, a lack of data sharing by companies and poor time management systems in the commission that have allowed staff to develop multiple overlapping restrictions, and to target marginal substances.\n\nA Commission spokesperson said: \u201cWe will look in more detail at the report by EEB and Client Earth, but we can already affirm that one year after the publication of the Restrictions Roadmap, there has been significant progress in the preparatory work for the restrictions identified in the Roadmap. For example, the restriction on formaldehyde, which is a carcinogenic substance restricted in consumer products is finalised and [has been] tabled for scrutiny to the co-legislators.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

The UK completed 29 removals, including Bowston Weir, which was built on the River Kent nearly 150 years ago for a paper mill. Its removal will help restore the health of the river, which is home to white-clawed crayfish, freshwater pearl mussels, and water crowfoot (an oxygenating aquatic plant).\n\n\u201cThese numbers make me proud because we\u2019re doing a lot to mainstream dam removal, and it works,\u201d said Herman Wanningen, director of the World Fish Migration Foundation (WFMF) and founder of Dam Removal Europe. \u201cIt shows countries are picking up speed on implementing this river restoration tool.\u201d\n\nAcross Europe, hundreds of rivers are blocked by dams, weirs, culverts and levees, with 15% considered obsolete, and many at risk of collapse.\n\nA dam is removed on the Tromsa River in Norway. Photograph: Rob Kleinjans\n\nIn Norway, dynamite was used to destroy a seven-metre-high dam that had blocked the Tromsa River since 1916. But the year\u2019s largest known project was the removal of La Roche qui Boit hydropower dam on the S\u00e9lune River in France.\n\nTwo countries \u2013 Latvia and Luxembourg \u2013 completed removals for the first time. \u201cSometimes the smallest projects make a difference for an entire country,\u201d said Wanningen.\n\nOne of the more surprising removals was the obsolete Bayurivka dam in Ukraine, where WWF-Ukraine\u2019s river restoration work continued, despite the war. Taking out the abandoned six-metre-high dam, in the Carpathian mountains of Verkhovyna national park, opened 27km of the Perkalaba River to migratory fish for the first time in 120 years and removed the risk of it collapsing.\n\n\u201cBy removing Bayurivka, we hope the river has a chance to again become a biodiversity hotspot,\u201d said Oksana Konovalenko, WWF-Ukraine\u2019s freshwater practice lead. \u201cProtected fish species, including brook trout, Danube salmon, and Ukrainian lamprey, are expected to return upstream and attract fish-eating animals, such as brown bear, otters and various bird species.\u201d\n\nAlmost 75% of the barriers removed were weirs, followed by culverts and dams. At least 10 hydropower dams were dismantled in England, Finland, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe number of removals was a 36% increase from the previous year when there were 239 removals.\n\n\u201cRemoving barriers to restore rivers\u2019 natural flow and connectivity brings many ecosystem service benefits, such as flood protection, water purification, and recreational opportunities,\u201d said Wanningen.\n\nSan Prudentzio dam on the Deba River was one of 133 barriers removed in Spain in 2022. Photograph: Gipuzkoa Provincial Council\n\nWith an estimated 150,000 old and obsolete dams and weirs across Europe, there is still a long way to go. \u201cDam removals are still controversial,\u201d said Wanningen. \u201cSome countries haven\u2019t even started yet, because the topic is too sensitive to talk about. Hydropower companies don\u2019t like seeing their dams going down, though [they] weren\u2019t economically viable any more. Local villagers are worried there will be more flooding, even though removing dams creates more space for flooding if done properly. It\u2019s a matter of providing the right information and making sure politicians and citizens understand why unnecessary dams should be removed.\u201d\n\nThe year-on-year increase in removals is expected to continue in 2023, as the argument for freeing rivers gathers momentum. \u201cI hope the European Commission accepts the new Nature Restoration Law this summer, which will give a solid policy base for member states to implement dam removal to restore 25,000km of rivers and maybe more,\u201d said Wanningen. \u201cAnd I hope we can keep this amazing movement growing.\u201d\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features","58":"From 1d ago 23.01 BST It's midnight in Sudan, and the ceasefire has begun The US-brokered ceasefire between the warring Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has officially started in Sudan, where hundreds have been killed and thousands have fled since the fighting began.

Ahead of the evening truce announcement, airstrikes and ground fighting shook Omdurman, one of three adjacent cities in the capital region, and there were also clashes in capital Khartoum, a Reuters reporter said. Dark smoke enveloped the sky near the international airport in central Khartoum, adjacent to army headquarters, and booms of artillery fire rattled the surroundings.\n\n\n\n1d ago 00.24 BST Here is more detail on Japan\u2019s evacuations so far. Japan has evacuated 45 nationals and their spouses from Sudan, and temporarily closed its embassy, prime minister Fumio Kishida and officials said Tuesday. \u201cA total of 45 people took off from eastern Sudan for Djibouti in the C2 transport aircraft dispatched\u201d by Japanese troops, Kishida told reporters in the early hours of Tuesday.

A few hours later, Japan\u2019s foreign minister said in a statement that the embassy was now temporarily closed after staff were evacuated. Japan had said it had roughly 60 citizens in Sudan when it decided to evacuate them. The foreign ministry will set up a liaison office in Djibouti to continue helping remaining Japanese in Sudan to evacuate, it said.\n\n\n\n1d ago 00.09 BST Summary Here are the key recent developments in Sudan: A US-brokered ceasefire between the warring Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces started in Sudan, where hundreds have been killed and thousands have fled since the fighting began. The 72-hour ceasefire was earlier announced by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who welcomed the warring parties\u2019 \u201ccommitment to work with partners and stakeholders for permanent cessation of hostilities and humanitarian arrangements\u201d.\n\nA British RAF plane landed at port city in the north-east of Sudan as a British minister said that the UK is evaluating further military options for rescuing non-diplomats from the country by land, sea and air.\n\nEurope has evacuated more than 1,000 citizens, according to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief.\n\nAfrican countries including Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria have also started evacuating citizens. Kenya has said it will not be withdrawing its diplomats from Sudan as it wants them to help negotiate a \u201cpeaceful solution\u201d to the conflict. The foreign secretary Alfred Mutua spoke at a press conference alongside US secretary of state Antony Blinken. On Twitter he went on to say some students have already been withdrawn and the country is in the process of rescuing another 300 people. He called for all Kenyans in Sudan to register with the embassy to enable their evacuation.\n\nThe head of the UN, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned that the situation in Sudan could engulf the whole region and that Sudan stands on the \u201cabyss\u201d. He said: \u201cLet me be clear: the United Nations is not leaving Sudan. Our commitment is to the Sudanese people, in support of their wishes for a peaceful and secure future. We stand with them at this terrible time. We must all do everything within our power to pull Sudan back from the edge of the abyss.\u201d\n\nThe French embassy in Khartoum will be closed until further notice. France has airlifted 491 people from 36 countries, including 12 EU nations, to Djibouti since Sunday, according to the ministry, Agence France Presse (AFP) reports. It has also sent a warship as part of the rescue effort.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken has raised concerns about the Russian mercenary force, the Wagner group, operating in Sudan. Wagner, who were founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, have been heavily engaged in the conflict in Ukraine after Russia\u2019s invasion. There is now a suggestion the group is active in Sudan. He told a press conference: \u201cWe do have deep concern about the engagement of the Prigozhin group \u2013 the Wagner group \u2013 in Sudan.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has said that the country has been able to fly more than 300 people out of Sudan.\n\nThe US is pushing for a ceasefire between the two warring factions in Sudan to be broadened to help bring the conflict to an end. Secretary of state Antony Blinken told a news conference that was talking \u201cdirectly\u201d with military leaders. Israel has offered to host ceasefire talks.\n\nThe British ambassador to Sudan was on holiday when fighting broke out in the country\u2019s capital Khartoum, according to a report in the Times of London.\n\n\n\n1d ago 00.04 BST Japan\u2019s military aircraft evacuated Japanese nationals and their family members totalling 45 people from Sudan, Kyodo news agency quoted prime minister Fumio Kishida as saying on Monday.\n\n\n\n1d ago 23.55 BST Of the Sudanese who can afford to leave, many are fleeing Khartoum on crowded buses on the more than 900-kilometre desert drive north to Egypt. Some of the 800,000 South Sudanese refugees who previously fled civil war in their own country are now choosing to return, according to the UN refugee agency. In Khartoum, street battles have left the sky often blackened by smoke from shelled buildings and torched shops, AFP reports. \u201cThere was a rocket strike in our neighbourhood \u2026 it is like nowhere is safe,\u201d resident Tagreed Abdin, an architect, told AFP. \u201cMorgues are full. Corpses litter the streets\u201d said Attiya Abdallah, head of the doctors\u2019 union, which on Monday reported scores more casualties after sites in south Khartoum were \u201cheavily shelled\u201d.\n\n\n\n1d ago 23.41 BST The US is helping from afar as thousands of Americans left behind in Sudan seek to escape fighting, after the US embassy evacuated all of its diplomatic personnel over the weekend and shut down. President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, defended the decision not to keep US forces or diplomats in Sudan to help its citizens evacuate as several US allies did and as the US has often done in conflict zones in the past. Instead, Sullivan told reporters, the US was now remotely assisting Americans trying to flee the country by road. US assistance on Monday included helping Americans link up with convoys of foreigners now attempting to make it through fighting toward safety on Sudan\u2019s eastern border. The US also is placing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets over the route from the capital, Khartoum, to the country\u2019s main seaport, the Port of Sudan, to scope out safety threats, Sullivan said.\n\n\n\n1d ago 23.32 BST Europe has evacuated more than 1,000 citizens, according to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief. France has airlifted 491 people from 36 countries, including 12 EU nations, to Djibouti since Sunday, while the Dutch defence ministry said a third flight carrying evacuees has left Sudan on Monday evening, transporting people to Jordan. Earlier on Monday, the government said about 60 Dutch nationals were successfully evacuated from Sudan. This photograph from the Etat Major des Armees (French defence staff) shows French military personnel at French military airbase in Djibouti before they fly for Khartoum during the \"Sagittaire\" evacuation of about 100 people from Sudan on the first French flight out of the war-hit country after a \"complicated\" rescue operation. Photograph: Adj Laure-Anne Maucorps Ep Derri\/Etat Major des Arm\u00e9es\/AFP\/Getty Images Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto said \u201call Italian civilians\u201d who had asked to leave had been evacuated \u2013 200 people flown out of the country in a military operation on Sunday. Vatican representatives were among those evacuated. Berlin said Monday three flights had left and a fourth was on its way to airlift a total of 400 people. A Spanish military plane with 100 passengers, 30 of them Spanish, left Sunday for Djibouti, Madrid said. And Finland said Monday it had evacuated 10 people so far.\n\n\n\n1d ago 23.25 BST Meanwhile, Britain is facing mounting pressure to rescue 4,000 British and dual nationals trapped in Sudan. The government has been criticised for extracting only diplomats and their families. A UK Foreign Office minister said the government was looking at \u201cevery single available option\u201d for rescuing British nationals and stressed the difficulties of such an operation.\n\nUpdated at 23.28 BST\n\n1d ago 23.19 BST In case you\u2019re just joining us: a three-day ceasefire is now in place in Sudan, and there are hopes that it will hold. Previous attempted ceasefires have failed over the course of 10 days of fighting that has so far killed at least 427 people and wounded more than 3,700, according to UN agencies. Hours before the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced the ceasefire, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had warned that the fighting could \u201cengulf the whole region and beyond\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 23.22 BST","59":"A ceasefire has come into effect in Sudan after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the two opposing forces in its civil war had agreed a three-day pause in hostilities.\n\n\u201cFollowing intense negotiation over the past 48 hours, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have agreed to implement a nationwide ceasefire starting at midnight on 24 April, to last for 72 hours,\u201d Blinken said in a written statement on Monday issued two hours before the ceasefire started.\n\nPrevious attempted ceasefires have failed over the course of 10 days of fighting that has so far killed at least 427 people and wounded more than 3,700, according to UN agencies. Hours before Blinken\u2019s announcement, the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had warned that the fighting could \u201cengulf the whole region and beyond\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must all do everything within our power to pull Sudan back from the edge of the abyss,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nBlinken\u2019s announcement suggested that the three-day ceasefire was intended to lead to talks on a longer-term truce.\n\n\u201cTo support a durable end to the fighting, the United States will coordinate with regional and international partners, and Sudanese civilian stakeholders, to assist in the creation of a committee to oversee the negotiation, conclusion and implementation of a permanent cessation of hostilities and humanitarian arrangements in Sudan,\u201d the secretary of state said.\n\nSudanese civilians trapped by the sudden outbreak of fighting are desperately short of food, water and medicine, aid agencies said.\n\n\u201cMorgues are full. Corpses litter the streets,\u201d said Attiya Abdallah, head of the doctors\u2019 union, on Monday according to the French Press Agency (AFP), saying that heavy shelling of south Khartoum had caused scores of new casualties.\n\nOver the weekend, nations from around the world carried out evacuations of their diplomats and other civilians.\n\nOn Monday, a Royal Air Force transport plane landed at Port Sudan in the north-east of the country, with the aim of collecting British nationals who managed to reach the north-eastern coastal city from Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. On Monday, a UN convoy arrived from the capital carrying 700 people, an 850km journey.\n\nThe United Nations head of mission, Volker Perthes, said the convoy arrived safely.\n\n\u201cThirty-five hours in a not so comfortable convoy are certainly better than three hours\u2019 bombing and sitting under the shells,\u201d he said.\n\nThe violence in Sudan has pitted army units loyal to its military ruler, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the Rapid Support Forces, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. Battles have been raging in Khartoum and its twin city of Omdurman over the past nine days.\n\nThe US military evacuated just under 100 embassy staff from Khartoum in three helicopters on Sunday, but the White House has said that a wider effort to airlift other Americans is unlikely in the next few days. Instead, the Pentagon said it is providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to help the state department identify potential land routes out of the country.\n\nThe EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said more than 1,000 EU citizens had been taken out during a \u201clong and intense weekend\u201d of airlift missions carried out by France, Germany and others. Beijing said it had evacuated an initial group of Chinese nationals and would \u201ctry every means to protect the lives, properties and safety of 1,500-plus Chinese compatriots in Sudan\u201d.","60":"Thousands more residents of Khartoum fled the Sudanese capital on Monday, risking long, dangerous journeys to escape continued street battles and murderous airstrikes that continue to cause significant civilian casualties.\n\nSome headed north by road to the Egyptian border in packed buses, many with towering piles of luggage strapped to them. Others drove north-east to Port Sudan. Both journeys involved up to 24 hours of driving, with increasing reports of robbery of vehicles.\n\nMany in Khartoum fear that rival factions fighting for control of the city will intensify their power struggle when the evacuations of foreign citizens have finished. The latest ceasefire, which brought almost no reduction in fighting, was due to run out Monday evening.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned a session of the security council in New York that the violence \u201crisks a catastrophic conflagration \u2026 that could engulf the whole region and beyond\u201d. He urged the 15 council members to work to end the violence.\n\n\u201cWe must all do everything within our power to pull Sudan back from the edge of the abyss \u2026 We stand with them at this terrible time,\u201d he said, adding he had authorised the temporary relocation of some UN personnel and families.\n\nThroughout the day, convoys of foreign diplomats, as well as teachers, students, workers and families from dozens of countries wound past combatants at tense frontlines in Khartoum to reach extraction points. A stream of European, Middle Eastern, African and Asian military aircraft flew in all day Sunday and Monday to ferry some of them out.\n\nThe violence in Sudan has pitted army units loyal to its military ruler, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the Rapid Support Forces, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. Few now believe that it is possible to bring the combatants to the negotiating table.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance of putting a lid on this now, none whatsoever,\u201d said Cameron Hudson, an expert in US-Africa policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\nMany in Khartoum have now been trapped in their homes for nine days. The prices of increasingly rare food and fuel are soaring, electricity is patchy and internet rarely working. In many neighbourhoods, armed fighters are looting shops and homes.\n\nResidents of Khartoum on Monday reported sporadic explosions, gunfire and airstrikes, including one in the neighbouring city of Omdurman that killed a reported five people and injured about 50. Shelling of Khartoum\u2019s Kalakla district continued for an hour until the area was \u201crazed to the ground\u201d, said Attiya Abdulla Atiya, secretary of the Sudan Doctors Syndicate. The bombardment sent dozens of wounded to the Turkish hospital, one of the few medical facilities still functioning in the city, he said.\n\nAbou-Obaida Abashar, a 33-year-old banker, fled his family house in the al-Fetihab neighbourhood after an airstrike hit his house and that of his neighbours.\n\n\u201cA plane was trying to hit 15 to 16 RSF vehicles in the area, but I am not sure if they meant to hit the houses or that came by accident, but it terrified everybody and it made us all run, some with only the clothes that they were wearing, they even didn\u2019t take anything with them. The area has been emptied now,\u201d Abashar said.\n\nThose without the funds to pay for transport to Egypt or Port Sudan headed out of the city to relatively calmer provinces along the Nile north and south of Khartoum. Many more were trapped, with limited cash and transport costs spiralling.\n\n\u201cTravelling out of Khartoum has become a luxury,\u201d said Shahin al-Sherif, a 27-year-old high school teacher hoping to arrange transport out of Khartoum for himself, his younger sister, mother, aunt and grandmother. The family had been trapped for days in their home in Khartoum\u2019s Amarat neighbourhood while fighting raged outside before managing to move to a safer district farther out.\n\nBut al-Sherif expects things to get worse and is worried his sister, aunt and grandmother, all diabetic, will not be able to get the supplies they need. Bus ticket prices have more than quadrupled so renting a bus for 50 people to get to the Egyptian border costs about $14,000, he said.\n\nSome Sudanese people have expressed anger that western countries have seemingly prioritised evacuating their people over trying to stop the fighting.\n\nWith a series of ceasefires failing to hold, the confirmed death toll in Sudan has now passed 420, including 264 civilians, and more than 3,700 people have been wounded, according to local and international NGOs. However, most analysts believe the true total of fatalities and injuries in more than nine days of fighting is much higher.\n\nThe US has warned of shortages of vital medicines, food and water in Sudan and deployed disaster response experts to the region.\n\nSamantha Power, the head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), painted a grim picture of the reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cFighting \u2026 has claimed hundreds of lives, injured thousands, and yet again dashed the democratic aspirations of Sudanese people. Civilians trapped in their homes cannot access desperately needed medicines, and face the prospect of protracted power, water and food shortages,\u201d Power said.\n\n\u201cAll of this suffering compounds an already dire situation: one-third of Sudan\u2019s population, nearly 16 million people, already needed humanitarian assistance to meet basic human needs before this outbreak of violence.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization has verified 11 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the conflict, with the remaining sites in Khartoum and the south-western Darfur states facing an acute lack of supplies amid increasing needs. Emergency medical supplies that had been pre positioned are now running out, the WHO said.\n\nInternet and phone services appeared to have collapsed across much of country. Medicine, fuel and food were scarce in much of Khartoum, while a combination of fighting and looting made leaving home to search for essential provisions dangerous.\n\nThe communications blackout has starved those still in the conflict areas of up-to-date information on the fighting and left their families abroad uncertain about their safety, with international calls also failing to connect. The few in Sudan with internet access have offered on social media to make local phone calls on behalf of those abroad.\n\nMaryam, a Sudanese student in the United Arab Emirates who did not want to use her real name for her family\u2019s safety, said she lost contact with her family on Sunday as they were on a bus heading from Khartoum to the Egyptian border.\n\nWhen she managed to finally get through on Monday afternoon, her family were waiting to cross over to Egypt. Their bus had broken down several times on the journey, during which the driver decided to raise the price and threatened to offload anyone who could not pay.\n\n\u201cThe last we\u2019d heard from them they\u2019d been about an hour from the border headed towards the Aswan border. Most of my family \u2013 including my sister, her kids and husband, some aunts, uncles and cousins \u2013 were on the bus together,\u201d Maryam said.\n\nThe Sudanese army has blamed the outages on the RSF damaging infrastructure.","61":"Israel\u2019s memorial day, in which those killed serving in the armed forces as well as terrorist attacks are honoured, is usually quiet and sombre; then, at sunset, independence day celebrations and fireworks begin.\n\nBut this year, as the country readies for the consecutive holidays, Israelis find themselves grappling with an unprecedented political crisis that has divided society and cast a shadow over what are supposed to be displays of national unity. A car ramming carried out by a Palestinian suspect with a Jerusalem residency on a busy street in the city on Monday afternoon, which injured five, added to the tensions.\n\nThree ministers appointed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on his return to office at the end of last year at the head of a coalition of far-right and religious parties have pulled out of participating in memorial day ceremonies at military cemeteries on Monday. The decision came after pleas from bereaved families who feared this year\u2019s events will be hijacked by politicians \u2013 or the 16-week-old protest movement against the government\u2019s controversial plans for the judiciary.\n\nMiri Regev, the minister in charge of the main event at Mount Herzl, Israel\u2019s main military cemetery, has instructed organisers to switch to broadcasting a recording of the dress rehearsal if the live event is disrupted by demonstrations.\n\nA plan to send the extremist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, as the government\u2019s representative at a ceremony in the southern town of Beersheba, has also drawn ire from some members of the community, who point out the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) exempted him from military service as a teenager owing to his far-right activities.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid announced last week he is boycotting the Mount Herzl ceremony, addressing the government in a statement: \u201cYou have torn Israeli society apart, and no phoney fireworks performance can cover that up.\u201d\n\nEli Ben-Shem, the chair of Yad Labanim, which commemorates Israel\u2019s war dead and offers relatives support, told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 on Sunday that the organisation had received hundreds of phone calls from families asking that politicians stay away from the Mount Herz event. He himself lost his son in a military helicopter crash during the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, in 1997.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned for the dignity of the fallen, worried about what could happen on Memorial Day with people standing there at the gravesites, cursing and shouting at one another. The State of Israel has managed to reach a ceasefire with Hamas,\u201d he said, referring to the Palestinian militant group in control of the blockaded Gaza Strip. \u201cCan\u2019t we make a ceasefire among ourselves?\u201d\n\nHeightened tensions and ugly rhetoric on a day that is supposed to supersede politics are not new: in 2022, some bereaved families, as well as Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, demanded that cabinet members in the short-lived \u201cgovernment of change\u201d stay away from memorial day ceremonies, accusing the broad coalition of supporting terrorism.\n\nBut the new government\u2019s plan to introduce a judicial overhaul, which critics say is a transparent power grab, has sparked the biggest protest movement in the country\u2019s history, exposing deep rifts in Israel society over identity and belonging.\n\nLast month, the prime minister was forced to freeze the legislation until the Knesset\u2019s summer session, and it may yet be kicked into the long grass. But the protests have continued unabated, and are expected at at least four different sites on Monday, as enough people question the democratic values of the country their loved ones died for.\n\nEvery year since 2006, an alternative memorial day ceremony known as the joint memorial day has been held for both Israelis and Palestinians who have lost family members and friends in the decades-old conflict.\n\nPeace activist Rami Elhanan of the Parents Circle \u2013 Families Forum, who lost his 14-year-old daughter in a suicide bombing in 1997, said the numbers were growing each year.\n\n\u201cWe can gather around this fire to get some encouragement and solidarity, to feel not all is lost.\n\n\u201cMost of the demonstrators are people who have woken up for the first time in their life and are realising now the threat of polarisation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were viewed as marginal for a long time. But many thousands are standing up now.\u201d","62":"The US has warned of shortages of vital medicines, food and water in Sudan and deployed disaster response experts to the region, as efforts intensified to evacuate foreign diplomats and citizens from Khartoum.\n\nOn Sunday, the UK successfully evacuated its diplomatic staff and their dependants from Khartoum in a complex operation, while Germany and France said they had each evacuated more than 100 people. Italy, Spain and Canada also evacuated their citizens among other nationalities. A Dutch military plane took evacuees to Jordan early on Monday, the Dutch foreign ministry said. The US evacuated diplomats, embassy workers and their families on Saturday night.\n\nWith a series of ceasefires failing to hold, the death toll in Sudan has passed 420, including 264 civilians, and more than 3,700 people have been wounded, according to local and international NGOs.

Their power struggle has raised fears of chaos and a humanitarian disaster in the country of 45 million people, Africa\u2019s third-largest.\n\nA new declared truce that was to coincide with the three-day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr collapsed on Saturday. The ceasefire was supposed to allow thousands of Khartoum residents who have been trapped by the fighting to reach safety and visit family during the Muslim holiday of Eid.\n\nPower reiterated calls for the parties to abide by the ceasefire.\n\nInternet and phone services appeared to have collapsed across much of country on Sunday.

The Taliban at the time were not aware of the identity of the person they killed, the official added.\n\nThe US military has informed families of the 11 marines, one sailor and one soldier killed in the blast during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDarin Hoover, the father of SSgt Darin Taylor Hoover, said the US Marines provided only limited information to him and did not identify the Islamic State leader or give the circumstances of his death.\n\nHoover is among a group of families that have kept in touch since the bombing, supporting one another and sharing information through a private group messaging chat.\n\nCheryl Rex, the mother of marine L\/Cpl Dylan Merola, who died in the blast, said it was through the chat group that they were informed late on Monday about the killing as they awaited official confirmation from US military officials.\n\nHoover said he and his son\u2019s mother, Kelly Henson, have spent the past year and a half grieving the death of the 31-year-old US Marine Corps staff sergeant and praying for accountability from the Biden administration for the handling of the withdrawal.\n\nThe killing of the unidentified Islamic State group leader, Hoover said, does nothing to help them.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens, it\u2019s not going to bring Taylor back and I understand that,\u201d he said in a phone call. \u201cAbout the only thing his mom and I can do now is be an advocate for him.

That\u2019s the frustrating part.\u201d\n\nHis son and the other fallen service members were among those screening the thousands of Afghans frantically trying on 26 August 2021 to get on to one of the crowded flights out of the country after the Taliban takeover.\n\nThe blast at Abbey Gate came hours after western officials warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport. But that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the US officially ended its 20-year presence.\n\nThe Afghanistan-based offshoot of the Islamic State, with up to 4,000 members, is the Taliban\u2019s most bitter enemy and top threat militarily.\n\nAfter the Trump administration reached a 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan and the Biden administration followed through on that agreement in 2021, there had been hope in Washington that the Taliban\u2019s desire for international recognition and assistance for the country\u2019s impoverished population might moderate their behavior.\n\nBut relations between the US and the Taliban have deteriorated significantly since they imposed draconian new measures banning girls from school and excluding women from working for international aid and health agencies.\n\nThe August 2021 pullout of US troops led to the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military, which the US had supported for nearly two decades, and the return to power of the Taliban. A review of the chaotic withdrawal released earlier this month largely laid blame on Trump, saying President Joe Biden was \u201cseverely constrained\u201d by the decisions of his predecessor.","64":"More than 100 Nepali guards who risked their lives to protect British embassy staff in Afghanistan before the Taliban seized back control were secretly returned to Nepal against their wishes shortly after being airlifted to safety in the UK, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nHundreds of Nepali nationals and a smaller number of Indian nationals who protected key institutions in Kabul were brought to the UK on an RAF flight during the chaotic evacuation of the Afghan capital by western countries in August 2021, as victorious Taliban forces closed in.\n\nIt has now emerged that days after they arrived in the UK, more than 100 of these evacuees were forcibly removed to their home countries even though many had been issued with six-month visas on arrival.\n\nThe Guardian has interviewed some of the deported guards, who believed their lives were in danger in Nepal. Some were forcibly removed from hotel rooms in the UK in areas including Northampton, Reading, Oxford and Swindon before completing what at the time was a mandatory 10-day period of Covid-19 pandemic hotel quarantine for new arrivals in the UK.\n\nNepal was designated as a red-list country, with UK government instructions that people should not travel there, when the former guards were flown back in 2021.\n\nSome have managed to find their way back to the UK since 2021 and have claimed asylum.\n\nIn March, at least 10 Nepali guards who protected the British embassy staff in Kabul and were still living in the UK were arrested in a raid at their west London hotel and detained by the Home Office.\n\nAfter the detentions came to light, the Home Office issued a statement saying that the removals of those detained had been paused \u201cpending further review\u201d. It said the evacuees were flown from Kabul as \u201ca gesture of goodwill\u201d with the understanding that they were expected to return to their home countries.\n\nMore than 100 of those forcibly removed from the UK have written to Rudra Dhakal, a British resident of Nepali heritage who is supporting them, with the Home Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, Nepalese government and UNHCR copied in, in a letter titled \u201cUrgent appeal for further humanitarian protection in the UK\u201d.\n\nThe deported guards wrote: \u201cWe were misled by the UK border security force. Therefore they forcefully deported us to Nepal against our will. At the time of our deportation we were never given the choice of staying in the UK for further humanitarian protection.\u201d\n\nDhakal, who is continuing to support the guards, said: \u201cThese bravest of the brave veterans said they provided frontline security \u2026 but they were left behind in the end. They were used as proxies on the frontline of the war.\u201d\n\nOne of those deported is Deepak Punmagar, 42. \u201cWe were always under threat in Afghanistan,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we would survive. When I arrived in the UK I felt safe but I was deported to Nepal on 17 August.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were never told of a gesture of goodwill and there was no understanding that they were liable to removal, let alone detained after a morning raid on their hotel. It is deeply concerning now to hear how many have been affected by this appalling situation.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain committed to providing protection for vulnerable and at-risk people fleeing Afghanistan and so far we have brought around 24,500 people to safety in the UK.\n\n\u201cA number of Nepalese nationals who were not deemed eligible for consideration under ACRS [the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme] were evacuated from Afghanistan as a gesture of goodwill. This came with the understanding that once in the UK, these individuals would arrange and be offered support for onward travel to the country of their nationality.\u201d\n\nThe Nepalese embassy has been approached for comment.","65":"The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski is facing criticism after the Kazakh government funded a \u00a35,100 trip for him to observe elections and quoted him praising the country\u2019s \u201cfunctioning democracy\u201d.\n\nKawczynski, a trade envoy for the prime minster, Rishi Sunak, travelled to watch parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan in March amid concerns among human rights groups about the treatment of Zhanbolat Mamai, the leader of the unregistered Democratic party. Mamai was this month banned from political activism and journalism for six years.\n\nKawczynski\u2019s trip, which was officially declared, was paid for by the Kazakh embassy, with \u00a34,500 spent on flights, \u00a3400 on accommodation and \u00a3200 on food.\n\nAfterwards, he was quoted on the Kazakh government website as saying: \u201cI must applaud the will of the Kazakh people in working together in such a short period of time, after the fall of the Soviet Union, to create this functioning democracy.\u201d\n\nFollowing the vote in March, independent election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE) in Europe said Kazakhstan had made progress towards democratic elections but noted limits on \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d and said some political groups were prevented from participation.\n\nIts preliminary conclusions said: \u201cFurther changes to the legal framework are needed to provide a sufficient basis for conducting democratic elections.\u201d\n\nKazakhstan is rated as 23 out of 100 in the Freedom House index, which assesses people\u2019s access to political rights and civil liberties in countries across the world. It says: \u201cParliamentary and presidential elections are neither free nor fair, and authorities have consistently marginalised or imprisoned genuine opposition figures.\u201d\n\nAsked about the trip and whether he stood by his statement that Kazakhstan was a functioning democracy, Kawczynski told the Guardian: \u201cI sat on the platform with four OSCE monitors and they were saying the same as me\u2026\n\n\u201cYou are trying to equate a post-Soviet satellite state with 30 years of independence to our own particular type of democracy. It\u2019s impossible to develop a democracy in 30 years [in] to one that\u2019s taken us 1,000 years to create.\n\nKawczynski continued: \u201cWhen you think they are sandwiched between Russia and China, two of the most authoritarian dictatorships in the world, I think it\u2019s extremely important to engage with countries like Kazakhstan that are genuinely trying to move towards a democratic system. Certainly, everything I saw there led me to believe \u2013 by talking to young journalists, NGOs and other people \u2013 that they are making significant strides. Whether or not those are the exact words I used, I don\u2019t recall.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrying to suggest, as the Guardian always does, and this is so typical of leftwing liberal elite bias, in the first inference that because my flights and hotel accommodation are being paid by the Kazakh government that I am somehow being used as a tool is so shallow and disrespectful ... If the House of Commons had a budget, if journalists did not constantly denigrate parliament and parliamentarians about being able to travel abroad, we would have a budget to do these things, but of course we don\u2019t, so we have to go at the invitation of foreign countries.\u201d\n\nMamai was targeted in February 2022 after being accused of playing a part in orchestrating protests that swept Kazakhstan in January last year. The protests led to the killing of 238 people and human rights groups say 10,000 were detained. Earlier this year, Tory MP Robert Buckland and former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald were denied access to Mamai while on a high-profile trip to examine Kazakhstan\u2019s human rights record.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This included fines for having extra children, forced abortions and sterilisations. While initially highly effective in controlling the population, these policies became a victim of their own success, and the country is now grappling with an ageing population in steep decline, which could have severe economic implications.\n\nPart of the problem is that because of a traditional preference for boys, the one-child policy led to a massive gender imbalance. Men now outnumber women by about 32 million. \u201cHow can the country now shore up birth rates, with millions of missing women?\u201d asks Mei Fong, the author of One Child, a book about the impact of the policy.\n\nRecent policies introduced in China trying to incentivise women to have more children have done little to stimulate population growth. Women still have only 1.2 children and the population is expected to fall by almost 10% in the next two decades. According to projections, the size of the Chinese population could drop below 1 billion before the end of the century.\n\nChina\u2019s ageing population is an obstacle to economic development, with the number of working age people in the country declining by 38 million in the last three years.\n\nPhotograph: Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images\n\nIn India, the population has grown by more than a billion since 1950. Though growth has now slowed, the number of people in the country is still expected to continue to rise for the next few decades, hitting its peak of 1.7 billion by 2064. Today on average 86,000 babies are born a day in India compared with just 49,400 in China.\n\nPoonam Muttreja, executive director of Population Foundation of India, said that while some were concerned at the implications of being the world\u2019s most populous country, she said that India\u2019s population growth was no longer facing the \u201cexplosion\u201d many had feared.\n\n\u201cEarlier projections said we would overtake China in 2027 so it\u2019s happened four years faster, mostly because of our young population,\u201d said Muttreja. \u201cBut at the same time, we have also reduced our population growth and reached population stabilisation faster than we had imagined and it will continue to slow down as long as we stay on the right track. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for alarm.\u201d\n\nThe exact size of India\u2019s population is still not known, due to a delay in the government carrying out the census, which usually takes place every decade. It was due in 2021, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, has yet to announce the date it will commence.\n\nSome have accused the Modi government of obstructing the census process in order to disguise data that could be politically disadvantageous. However, the government say the delay is due to an ongoing effort to incorporate technology into the process.\n\nThe announcement by the UN is likely to increase pressure on the Indian government to carry out the survey. According to predictions the population has grown by almost 200 million \u2013 greater than the population of Brazil \u2013 since the last census in 2011 and experts say the lack of vital data is hindering policymaking and welfare programmes.\n\nIndia\u2019s demography is far from uniform across the country. One third of predicted population growth over the next decade will come from just two states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in the north of the country, which are some of India\u2019s poorest and most agricultural states. Uttar Pradesh alone already has a population of about 235 million, bigger than Nigeria or Brazil.\n\nMeanwhile states in India\u2019s south, which is more prosperous and has far higher rates of literacy, population rates have already stabilised and have begun to fall. In the next decade, states in the southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu are likely to start grappling with an ageing population, and by 2025, one in five people in Kerala will be over 60.\n\nPeople crowd at a market in New Delhi, India. The country\u2019s population has grown by more than one billion in the last 70 years. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nThe divide in population growth between India\u2019s north and south could also have political implications. After 2026, India\u2019s electoral lines are due to be revised and redrawn based on census data, in particular relating to the number of people in constituencies.\n\nMany politicians in southern states have expressed concern that their successes in bringing down population numbers, through education programmes, family planning and high literacy, could result in a reduction in their political representation in parliament, and a further political domination of the northern states that continue to have a population boom.\n\nCurrently the average age in India is just 29, and the country will continue to have a largely youthful population for the next two decades. A similar \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d proved highly useful in China, leading to an economic boom, particularly in manufacturing.\n\nWhile India has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies in the world, and recently overtook the UK as the fifth-largest, experts have stressed that the country needs more investment in education and employment to seize the opportunity presented by a young population over the next few decades.\n\nIndia continues to struggle with high youth unemployment and less than 50% of working-age Indians are in the workforce. The figure for women is even lower, with just 20% of women participating in the formal labour market, a figure that is decreasing as India develops.\n\nAdditional reporting by Amy Hawkins","67":"Indian police have arrested a separatist leader who revived calls for an independent Sikh homeland and the secession of India\u2019s northern Punjab state, which has a history of violent insurgency.\n\nAmritpal Singh had been on the run since March after capturing national attention in February when hundreds of his supporters stormed a police station in the Punjab town of Ajnala with wooden batons, swords and guns to demand the release of a jailed aide.\n\nState police said on Sunday that Singh was arrested in the Punjab town of Moga. The police appealed to people to maintain peace and harmony.\n\nA Sikh religious leader, Jasbir Singh Rodde, said Singh surrendered to police after offering morning prayers at a Sikh shrine in Moga. Police then arrested him and took him away, he said.\n\nPunjab suffered a bloody insurgency in the 1980s that led to the killing of India\u2019s then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards at her official residence in New Delhi. Her killing triggered bloody rioting by her Hindu supporters against Sikhs in northern India.\n\nPolice declared Singh, a 30-year-old preacher, a fugitive and accused him and his aides of creating discord in the state. Police accused him and his associates of spreading disharmony among people, attempted murder, attacking police personnel and obstructing public servants\u2019 lawful discharge of duty.\n\nAuthorities have deployed thousands of paramilitary soldiers in the state and arrested nearly 100 of his supporters. Singh\u2019s wife was prevented from leaving India last week.\n\nVery little was known about Singh until he arrived in Punjab state in 2022 and began leading marches calling for the protection of rights for Sikhs, who account for about 1.7% of India\u2019s population.\n\nSingh claims to draw inspiration from Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant leader accused by the Indian government of leading an armed insurgency for Khalistan in the 1980s. Bhindranwale and his supporters were killed in 1984 when the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion.\n\nSingh has styled himself after Bhindranwale with a long, flowing beard. He also dresses like Bhindranwale.\n\nSingh also heads Waris Punjab De, or Punjab\u2019s Heirs, an organisation that was part of a huge campaign to mobilise farmers against controversial agriculture reforms being pushed by the government of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. The legislation triggered a year of protests that began in 2020, as farmers \u2013 most of them Sikhs from Punjab state \u2013 camped on the outskirts of New Delhi through a harsh winter and devastating coronavirus surge. The protests ended after Modi\u2019s government withdrew the legislation in November 2021.\n\nWaris Punjab De was founded by Deep Sidhu, an Indian actor who died in 2022 in a traffic accident.\n\nSingh\u2019s speeches have become increasingly popular among supporters of the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India. Officials see it and affiliated groups as a national security threat. Even though the movement has waned over the years, it still has some support in Punjab and beyond, including in countries such as Canada, the US and the UK, which are home to a sizeable Sikh diaspora.\n\nLast month, supporters of the movement pulled down the Indian flag at the country\u2019s high commission in London and smashed the building\u2019s windows in a show of anger against the move to arrest Singh. India\u2019s foreign ministry denounced the incident and summoned the UK\u2019s deputy high commissioner in New Delhi to protest against what it called the breach of security at the embassy in London.\n\nThe supporters of the Khalistan movement also vandalised the Indian consulate in San Francisco.","68":"The last remaining Gurkha recipient of Britain\u2019s Victoria Cross has died in Nepal at the age of 83.\n\nRambahadur Limbu was awarded Britain\u2019s highest military decoration by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 1966 for gallantry during an attack on Indonesian troops on the island of Borneo during which he rescued two fellow soldiers.\n\nLimbu, then a lance corporal, carried out the mission in November 1965, part of the three-year \u201ckonfrotasi\u201d conflict known as the Battle of Bau triggered by Indonesia\u2019s opposition to the formation of Malaysia.\n\nIn a statement, the Gurkha Brigade Association said: \u201cHe has been a figurehead and exemplar of Gurkha bravery for generations of Gurkha recruits and soldiers. His loss will be felt profoundly by all those he has inspired.\u201d\n\nLimbu was a member of the Brigade of Gurkhas, made up of Nepalese soldiers who have been recruited to the British army since a peace treaty between the two countries was signed in 1815.\n\nThe soldier, who rose through the ranks to captain, served in the Sultan of Brunei\u2019s Army after leaving the British army in 1985.\n\nQueen Elizabeth with Rambahadur Limbu (left) during a reception for living recipients of the Victoria and George Cross medals in 2018.

All I cared about was rescuing my friends.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Limbu travelled to Westminster to speak during the Gurkha Welfare Inquiry into concerns over pension rights, adult dependants, compensation, equal treatment for Gurkha widows and free medical treatment for veterans in Nepal similar to that provided for pensioners in the UK.\n\nLimbu lived in the eastern Nepali city of Damak after retiring in 1992.\n\nThe British ambassador to Nepal, Nicola Pollitt, travelled to Damak in September 2022 in order for Limbu to sign the condolence book for Queen Elizabeth II after her death.\n\n\u201cHe signed the book, recalling with pride and sadness his long service for Her Majesty,\u201d Pollitt tweeted at the time.\n\nAt the Queen\u2019s funeral in September, 17 of the then 23 living recipients of the Victoria Cross and the George Cross for civilian gallantry were in attendance, including one from New Zealand and four from Australia.\n\nLimbu is survived by his wife, Eunimaya, and three children.","69":"Yusuf Islam, the musician formerly known as Cat Stevens, has addressed King Charles III ahead of his coronation with a 10-point list entitled Manifesto for a Good King.\n\n\u201cEven if you are a King, you are still a servant of God\u201d, the list begins, and goes on to include instructions to \u201cfeed the hungry\u201d, \u201chelp the sick and homeless\u201d, \u201cbeware of negative people in your circle\u201d and \u201clisten to constructive criticism\u201d.\n\nIn an additional message, the 74-year-old singer-songwriter said: \u201cOne of the privileges of being an artist is to express what seems unimaginable, and then hang it up there for people to ponder; we can say things that others can\u2019t. Sure, I know full well music can\u2019t necessarily solve the world\u2019s problems, but it can help to direct the narrative.\u201d\n\nHe released a new single, the title track from upcoming album King of a Land, alongside the manifesto, and said that the major message of the track \u2013 to not \u201cforget that there\u2019s One above you, and be careful to look out for those who are below you\u201d \u2013 applies to all of those in leadership positions.\n\nThe song is Islam\u2019s first release since 2020\u2019s Tea for the Tillerman 2, a reworking of his 1970 album, and his first brand new music since 2017.\n\nHe began releasing music in 1966, putting out 11 albums within the first 12 years of his career. After converting to Islam in 1977, and subsequently adopting the name Yusuf Islam, he ceased releasing music in 1979, auctioning all his guitars for charity and instead choosing to devote himself to running Islamic schools for children.\n\nHe returned to pop music in 2006 with An Other Cup, his first release under the name Yusuf, an alias he continued to perform under for his next two albums, 2009\u2019s Roadsigner and 2014\u2019s Tell \u2019Em I\u2019m Gone.\n\nNow known professionally as Yusuf\/Cat Stevens, the artist has long used music as a tool to engage with current affairs and to open up conversations with leaders and political figures.\n\nIn 2016, he performed in a rare live concert by the Houses of Parliament to coincide with the release of his single He Was Alone, which draws attention to the plight of lone child refugees.\n\nSpeaking at the time, he said: \u201cI have agencies saying to me: \u2018We can get you so many millions [to do a tour],\u2019 but I am not interested in that. I am more interested in the cause and in bridge-building.\u201d\n\nTo honour 2021\u2019s International Day of Peace, he recorded a new version of his 1971 hit Peace Train in collaboration with over 25 musicians from 12 countries, raising money for Playing for Change, an initiative that builds music and art schools for children.\n\nAlongside his musical endeavours, he is also at the helm of the charity Peace Train, which provides food, safe water and playgrounds across the world.\n\nEarly last year, the organisation supplied widowed families in Sindh, Pakistan with livestock, tools and seeds; in October, he performed in Istanbul and Ankara to raise money for the charity.\n\nKing of a Land, his 17th studio album, is said to be more than a decade in the making; across its 12 songs, he invites the listener to imagine an alternative universe, \u201cwhere happy endings can possibly happen\u201d.\n\nThe full album will be released on 16 June.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The average amount owed by households who are in debt has risen, however, from \u00a3188 to \u00a3234.\n\nThe Uswitch research showed that customers in Plymouth had the highest average credit balance, at \u00a3603, while those in Norwich were most in debt, at \u00a3348 on average. Leeds was the city with the highest proportion of households in energy debt, at 19%.\n\nConsumers are entitled to request that money held by their energy supplier is returned to them although just 14% of 2,003 UK energy bill payers said they intended to do this. More than half intend to leave those funds with their supplier to reduce future bills.\n\nRichard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: \u201cThis high level of any credit suggests that energy-saving awareness campaigns and cost-of-living support have played a part in protecting consumers from what could have been an even more difficult winter.\n\n\u201cIt could also raise the question of whether direct debits set by suppliers in reaction to the energy price hikes have been much higher than they needed to be.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government intervened last autumn to cushion the worst of the effects, subsidising bills through schemes administered via energy companies.\n\nThe new research could reignite an industry row over whether customer deposits should be ringfenced. Ofgem, the energy regulator, accused suppliers of using customers \u201clike an interest-free company credit card\u201d but later stopped short of ordering full ringfencing.\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian reported on the approach to credit balances by each company after accusations from consumers that they were being bullied by their energy suppliers.","71":"Pret a Manger is upping the cost of its subscription service by a fifth \u2013 but adding a 10% discount on food and snacks alongside free drinks to the offer from Wednesday \u2013 as the sandwich chain warns that the \u201cinflationary challenge\u201d remains.\n\nIts chief executive, Pano Christou, said Pret a Manger may have to put wages up again this year \u2013 after a 19% rise in the past year \u2013 amid stiff competition for workers.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to look after our people in this very challenging time,\u201d he said. Christou claimed Pret did not have staffing issues as its pay was \u201cmore attractive than the competition\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s costs have jumped, with the wholesale price of milk paid by Pret up 16%, coffee 48% and crisps 125%. It has dropped some products, such as a salmon and mango salad, as a 40% rise in the price of salmon was too much for customers to bear. The price of a latte has gone up just under 12% year on year, from \u00a32.95 to \u00a33.30.\n\n\u201cWe are in an inflationary challenge right now.\u201d Christou said. \u201cWe are not passing everything on and we are not seeing the same sort of percentage of inflation as the supermarkets.\u201d\n\nPret\u2019s subscription service, which first launched in September 2020, will be rebranded Club Pret and will now cost \u00a330 a month, up from \u00a325. It will include up to five barista-prepared drinks a day \u2013 the same as under the existing subscription offer \u2013 as well as 10% off everything else sold in Pret\u2019s stores, except at some service stations.\n\nDrinks included in the offer are coffee, tea, hot chocolate and iced drinks. Pret stopped making smoothies and frappes, which were previously included in the subscription, this month. However, a new range of shakes will be included when they launch in July.\n\nPret, which has 439 stores in the UK and employs almost 8,000 staff, says its subscription service, which increased in price from \u00a320 a month to \u00a325 last year, is redeemed 1.25m times a week \u2013 up 11% year-on-year.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Christou said recent strike action on public transport and at schools had hit sales, as they had interrupted people\u2019s plans. The cost of living crisis has also prompted customers to rein in on deliveries and be careful about their food choices \u2013 although they are spending more at weekends after more days at home for many.","72":"Half of school leaders in England say they are having to cut school trips and outings, with children in disadvantaged areas more likely to lose out, according to polling.\n\nAlmost two-thirds (63%) of senior leaders who took part in the survey are having to cut teaching assistants, while a quarter are reducing sports, extracurricular activities and the number of GCSE and A-level subject choices available to their pupils.\n\nThe survey of more than 1,400 state school staff, carried out by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) on behalf of the Sutton Trust educational charity, indicates there has been a sharp increase in cuts to activities and support staff over the last year.\n\nThe proportion of senior leaders cutting trips and outings has more than doubled since last year (from 21% to 50%), with 68% of leaders in the most deprived schools reporting having to make cuts, compared with 44% in the wealthiest.\n\nThose cutting the number of teaching assistants went up from 42% in 2022 to 63% this year, while the proportion having to make cuts to subject choices available to pupils went up from 17% for GCSEs and 16% for A-levels to about a quarter in 2023.\n\nTwo out of five school leaders (41%) polled admit they are having to use pupil premium money \u2013 funding intended to improve the educational outcomes of the most disadvantaged \u2013 to cover shortfalls in their overall budget. The proportion has gone up from 33% last year and is the biggest since the Sutton Trust began polling for its Teacher Voice Omnibus Survey in 2017.\n\nCarl Cullinane, the director of research and policy at the Sutton Trust, said the survey revealed a \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d picture. He said: \u201cIn the midst of a cost of living crisis and the continuing impact of the pandemic, schools are having to cut essential staff and activities for pupils.\n\n\u201cFunding for poorer pupils through the pupil premium is more important than ever in the context of these pressures. It is deeply concerning that increasing numbers of schools report having to use their pupil premium funding to plug budget gaps.\u201d\n\nCullinane continued: \u201cIt is vital that this funding is used to narrow the gaps in progress that have opened alarmingly in the wake of the pandemic. The government must urgently review the funding given to schools, particularly those in the most deprived areas, in light of these trends.\u201d\n\nThe backdrop to the cuts is the long-running teacher recruitment crisis, which shows no sign of easing. Almost three-quarters (71%) of those polled said they were having difficulties recruiting teachers this year \u2013 with a quarter (26%) having faced difficulties \u201cto a great extent\u201d \u2013 up from 70% in 2019.\n\nThe shadow schools minister, Stephen Morgan, said: \u201cChildren are missing out on the enrichment brought by school trips, sports, drama and are having their subject choices at GCSE limited because of the government\u2019s continued neglect of our schools.\u201d\n\nKevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the Sutton Trust report exposed the impact of \u201cdecades of government underfunding\u201d.\n\nGeoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the crisis was severe and worsening. \u201cThe young people who are suffering the most are those in the most disadvantaged communities. The government\u2019s insistence that an extra \u00a32bn for school funding in 2023-24 will fix every funding problem is at odds with reality.\u201d\n\nMembers of the National Education Union are due to go out on strike on Thursday and again next Tuesday in pursuit of their fully funded, above-inflation pay claim, as industrial action threatens to spread to other teachers\u2019 unions who have also rejected the government\u2019s latest offer.\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said school funding next year would be at its highest level in history in real terms thanks to an additional \u00a32bn of investment for both 2023\/24 and 2024\/25, adding: \u201cEvery school in England is set to benefit from this boost, which will support schools with salary uplifts, as well as things like school trips and essential learning materials.\u201d","73":"Two temperate rainforests in Wales and on the Isle of Man have been named as the first to be restored by the Wildlife Trusts, as part of a wider programme to help the rare habitat recover across the British Isles.\n\nTemperate rainforests, also known as Atlantic or Celtic rainforests, are found in places with exposure to the sea \u2013 areas with \u201chigh oceanicity\u201d \u2013 and receive high rainfall and humidity, with a low variation in annual temperature. It is a globally rare habitat, thought to be more threatened than tropical rainforest.\n\nRainforests in Britain cover just 1% of the country, as they have mostly been destroyed by agriculture and development over hundreds of years. Temperate rainforests are very lush and often contain rare plants, lichens and fungi.\n\nAt Creg y Cowin on the Isle of Man, more than 28 hectares (70 acres) will be planted with native tree species, and 8 hectares will be allowed to regenerate naturally.\n\nThe Manx Wildlife Trust will also look after non-planted areas such as lowland heath, fen-meadow, waxcap grassland and ponds, to provide a mosaic of habitats for wildlife. They will use conservation grazing in some areas to maintain diversity of habitat. The charity hopes oakwood dwellers including wood warbler, pied flycatcher and redstart will return, as well as raptors, owls and woodland invertebrates.\n\nTunbridge filmy fern at Coed Crafnant, in north Wales. Temperate rainforests often contain rare plants, lichens and fungi. Photograph: Ben Porter\/c\/o Wildlife Trusts\n\nThe area will also aim to bring benefits for the local community, as it is hoped it will increase water purity for the West Baldwin reservoir and help with flood prevention, and contribute to a nature recovery network in the Isle of Man.\n\nAt Bryn Ifan, Gwynedd, the North Wales Wildlife Trust will plant 40 hectares of rainforest on Bwlch Mawr, the mountain overlooking Bryn Ifan. It will use native planting as well as natural regeneration to boost temperate rainforest. While some areas will be dedicated to nature-friendly farming, conservationists will also improve nearby wetlands to help the marsh fritillary butterfly. Tree species will include oak, birch and alder, and the area will be managed by conservation grazing.\n\nGuy Shrubsole, environmental campaigner and author of The Lost Rainforests of Britain, said: \u201cThere\u2019s real momentum now to restore and expand our amazing temperate rainforests, and it\u2019s brilliant to see the Wildlife Trusts advancing their plans.\n\n\u201cBut this should also be a kick in the pants to the UK government. If ministers want to see more farmers and landowners follow the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 example in restoring rainforest and other vital habitats, they need to unlock funding, support the removal of invasive rhododendron, and publish a rainforests strategy for the country.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

At the heart of that pledge is recruiting 20,000 additional police officers.\n\n\u201cWe await the final statistics \u2026 but, as I have previously set out, I am confident we are on the cusp of meeting that promise.\u201d\n\nBefore the 2019 election, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson pledged to recruit 20,000 more police officers in England and Wales by March 2023. The official data will be published on Wednesday.\n\nLast week, Sunak told MPs at prime minister\u2019s questions before the official release of the figures that there were \u201c20,000 more police officers\u201d, in what was a technical breach of data rules.\n\nIn March 2010, the total number of police officers in England and Wales was 143,734. By March 2016, that figure had fallen to 124,066.\n\nThe home secretary, Suella Braverman, is due to give a speech on Wednesday, calling on police officers to no longer \u201cpander to political correctness\u201d and focus instead on catching criminals.\n\nBraverman is to say at the Public Safety Foundation thinktank launch in central London: \u201cMy mantra at the Home Office is simple: more police, less crime, safer streets and common sense policing.\n\n\u201cMy vision for common sense policing is as clear as the public\u2019s.

The bulk of Microsoft sales still come from selling software and cloud computing services to customers.\n\nBut the company has grabbed headlines this year with its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and sprucing up the Bing search engine with artificial intelligence technology.\n\nMicrosoft said growth at its cloud business Azure was 27% in the latest reported quarter, beating analyst expectations for 26.6% growth, according to the consensus from 23 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.\n\nChief executive Satya Nadella told investors on a conference call that the company had more than 2,500 Azure-OpenAI service customers and AI-powered features in a wide array of products.\n\nBing, long an also-ran to search engine to Google, has 100 million daily users and has seen downloads jump since the addition of AI features, Nadella said.\n\nMicrosoft forecast revenue in the Intelligent Cloud unit for the current quarter, the fiscal fourth, of $23.6-23.9bn compared with Wall Street\u2019s average target of $23.8bn, according to Refinitiv.\n\nIt saw revenue in the More Personal Computing segment of $13.35-13.75bn, which would top Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $13.2bn. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, which includes Office, was seen producing revenue of $17.9-18.2bn, which would beat the analysts\u2019 average target of $17.8bn.\n\nAnalysts had expected a gloomy economic outlook to hit Microsoft\u2019s Windows business, which depends heavily on PC sales that have sagged in recent quarters. The sales drop in the segment was less severe than analysts expected, with Microsoft reporting revenue of $13.3bn versus analyst estimates of $12.19bn, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe company\u2019s productivity segment, which includes its Office software and advertising sales for the LinkedIn social networking site, also beat analyst expectations with revenue of $17.5bn versus estimates of $16.99bn, according to Refinitiv.\n\nOverall revenue for the company\u2019s cloud unit, which includes Azure as well as other services, was $22.1bn, slightly above estimates of $21.85bn, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nAlphabet Inc, which also has a large cloud business, reported strong results on Tuesday, lifting its shares 2.4% after the bell. Those results and Microsoft\u2019s helped boost shares of Amazon.com Inc, another major cloud operator, 4.8% in after hours trading.","76":"Washington\u2019s Governor Jay Inslee signed a trio of bills meant to prevent gun violence on Tuesday \u2013 one banning the sale of certain semi-automatic rifles, one imposing a 10-day waiting period on firearms purchases, and one clearing the way for lawsuits against gun makers or sellers in certain cases.\n\nA crowd of gun-control activists and Democratic lawmakers broke into cheers as he signed the measures, which he said would not solve all gun violence but would save lives.\n\n\u201cJust because they don\u2019t solve all the problems does not mean the state of Washington does not take action,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cInaction against gun violence is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, praised Washington state officials for passing the ban on selling specific semi-automatic weapons. President Joe Biden \u201ccommends the leadership of Washington Governor Jay Inslee and legislative leaders as well as the advocates, survivors and elected officials who fought for years to make today a reality\u201d, she said.\n\nThe ban on some semi-automatic weapon sales drew a quick legal challenge from the Second Amendment Foundation, based in Bellevue, Washington; and the Firearms Policy Coalition, based in Sacramento, California. The groups sued in US district court in Tacoma on Tuesday, saying the law violates the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.\n\n\u201cThe state of Washington has criminalized one of the most common and important means by which its citizens can exercise their fundamental right to self-defense,\u201d the plaintiffs said.\n\nInslee and the state attorney general Bob Ferguson, both Democrats, pushed for the Democratic-controlled Washington legislature to pass the ban on many semi-automatic weapons this session after years of failed attempts. The US is setting a record pace for mass killings this year, all of which have involved firearms, according to a database maintained by the Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University.\n\nWashington\u2019s new law prohibits the future sale, distribution, manufacture and import of more than 50 types of guns, including AR- and AK-style rifles. The measure does not bar the possession of the weapons by people who already have them.\n\nWashington is the 10th state \u2013 after California, Hawaii, Illinois and New York \u2013 to enact such a law.\n\nThe bill concerning lawsuits against gun manufacturers and sellers requires them to exercise reasonable controls in making, selling and marketing weapons, including steps to keep guns from being sold to people known to be dangerous or to buyers who might buy weapons on someone else\u2019s behalf. It allows the attorney general or private parties, such as the family members of victims, to sue over violations or damages.\n\nThe third measure, including the 10-day waiting period, will create an important buffer between people in crisis and a firearm, Inslee said. That measure also requires all gun buyers to show they\u2019ve taken safety training.\n\nWashington has moved to tighten the state\u2019s gun laws in recent years, after a young man in 2016 used a newly purchased AR-15 semi-automatic rifle with a 30-round magazine to kill three teens and wound another at a house party north of Seattle.\n\nLast year the governor signed a package of gun bills, including one that banned the manufacture, distribution and sale of firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.","77":"Harry Belafonte, the singer, actor and civil rights activist who broke down racial barriers, has died aged 96.\n\nAs well as performing global hits such as Day-O (The Banana Boat Song), winning a Tony award for acting and appearing in numerous feature films, Belafonte spent his life fighting for a variety of causes. He bankrolled numerous 1960s initiatives to bring civil rights to Black Americans; campaigned against poverty, apartheid and Aids in Africa; and supported leftwing political figures such as Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro and Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez.\n\nThe cause of death was congestive heart failure, his spokesman told the New York Times. Figures including Joe Biden, the rapper Ice Cube and Mia Farrow paid tribute to Belafonte. The US president said Belafonte was a \u201cgroundbreaking American who used his talent and voice to help redeem the soul of our nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cHarry Belafonte\u2019s accomplishments are legendary and his legacy of outspoken advocacy, compassion, and respect for dignity will endure forever,\u201d Biden said on Twitter.\n\nThe US news anchor Christiane Amanpour tweeted that he \u201cinspired generations around the whole world in the struggle for non-violent resistance justice and change. We need his example now more than ever.\u201d\n\nBernice King, daughter of Dr Martin Luther King, shared a picture of Belafonte at her father\u2019s funeral and said that he \u201cshowed up for my family in very compassionate ways. In fact, he paid for the babysitter for me and my siblings.\u201d The Beninese-French musician Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo called Belafonte \u201cthe brightest star in every sense of that word. Your passion, love, knowledge and respect for Africa was unlimited.\u201d\n\nBelafonte was born in 1927 in working-class Harlem, New York, and spent eight years of his childhood in his impoverished parents\u2019 native Jamaica. He returned to New York for high school but struggled with dyslexia and dropped out in his early teens. He took odd jobs working in markets and the city\u2019s garment district, and then signed up to the US navy aged 17 in March 1944, working as a munitions loader at a base in New Jersey.\n\nAfter the war ended, he worked as a janitor\u2019s assistant, but aspired to become an actor after watching plays at New York\u2019s American Negro Theatre (along with fellow aspiring actor Sidney Poitier). He took acting classes \u2013 where his classmates included Marlon Brando and Walter Matthau \u2013 paid for by singing folk, pop and jazz numbers at New York club gigs, where he was backed by groups whose members included Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nHe released his debut album in 1954, a collection of traditional folk songs. His second album, Belafonte, was the first No 1 in the new US Billboard album chart in March 1956, but its success was outdone by his third album the following year, Calypso, featuring songs from his Jamaican heritage. It brought the feelgood calypso style to many Americans for the first time, and became the first album to sell more than a million copies in the US.\n\nThe lead track was Day-O (The Banana Boat Song), a signature song for Belafonte \u2013 it spent 18 weeks in the UK singles chart, including three weeks at No 2. His version of Mary\u2019s Boy Child was a UK chart-topper later that year, while Island in the Sun reached No 3. He released 30 studio albums, plus collaborative albums with Nana Mouskouri, Lena Horne and Miriam Makeba. The latter release won him one of his two Grammy awards; he was later awarded a lifetime achievement Grammy and the Academy\u2019s president\u2019s merit award.\n\nBob Dylan\u2019s first recording \u2013 playing harmonica \u2013 was on Belafonte\u2019s 1962 album, Midnight Special. The previous year, Belafonte had been hired by Frank Sinatra to perform at John F Kennedy\u2019s presidential inauguration.\n\nA lifetime of activism \u2026 Belafonte with Martin Luther King Jr. Photograph: Hulton Archive\/Getty Images\n\nBelafonte maintained an acting career alongside music, winning a Tony award in 1954 for his appearance in the musical revue show, John Murray Anderson\u2019s Almanac, and appearing in several films, most notably as one of the leads in Island in the Sun, along with James Mason, Joan Fontaine and Joan Collins, with whom he had an affair. He was twice paired with Dorothy Dandridge, in Carmen Jones and Bright Road, but he turned down a third film, an adaptation of Porgy and Bess, which he found \u201cracially demeaning\u201d.\n\nHe later said the decision \u201chelped fuel the rebel spirit\u201d that was brewing in him, a spirit he parlayed into a lifetime of activism, using his newfound wealth to fund various initiatives. He was mentored by Martin Luther King Jr and Paul Robeson, and bailed King out of a Birmingham, Alabama, jail in 1963 as well as co-organising the march on Washington that culminated in King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. He also funded the Freedom Riders and SNCC, activists fighting unlawful segregation in the American south, and worked on voter registration drives.\n\nHe later focused on a series of African initiatives. He organised the all-star charity record We Are the World, raising more than $63m for famine relief, and his 1988 album, Paradise in Gazankulu, protested against apartheid in South Africa. He was appointed a Unicef goodwill ambassador in 1987, and later campaigned to eradicate Aids from Africa.\n\nAfter recovering from prostate cancer in 1996, he advocated for awareness of the disease.\n\nHe was a fierce proponent of leftwing politics, criticising hawkish US foreign policy, campaigning against nuclear armament, and meeting with both Castro and Chavez. At the meeting with Chavez, in 2006, he described US president George W Bush as \u201cthe greatest terrorist in the world\u201d. He also characterised Bush\u2019s Black secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as being like slaves who worked in their master\u2019s house rather than in the fields, criticisms that Powell and Rice rejected.\n\nHe was a frequent critic of Democrats, particularly Barack Obama, over issues including Guantanamo Bay detentions and the fight against rightwing extremism. He criticised Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 in 2012 for having \u201cturned their back on social responsibility \u2026 Give me Bruce Springsteen, and now you\u2019re talking. I really think he is Black.\u201d Jay-Z responded: \u201cYou\u2019re this civil rights activist and you just bigged up the white guy against me in the white media \u2026 that was just the wrong way to go about it.\u201d\n\n00:40 Harry Belafonte explains how his mother inspired him into activism \u2013 video\n\nHe continued to take occasional acting roles. In 2018, he appeared in the Spike Lee movie BlacKkKlansman. In 2014, 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen announced he was working with Belafonte on a film about Paul Robeson, though it wasn\u2019t developed.\n\nBelafonte was married three times, first to Marguerite Byrd, from 1948 to 1957, with whom he had two daughters, activist Adrienne and actor Shari. He had two further children with his second wife, Julie Robinson: actor Gina and music producer David. He and Robinson divorced after 47 years, and in 2008 he married Pamela Frank, who survives him.","78":"First Republic Bank\u2019s shares closed down 50% on Tuesday, a day after the mid-sized US bank announced a dramatic slump in deposits.\n\nOn Monday the San Francisco-headquartered reported a more than $100bn plunge in deposits in the quarter in the aftermath, sparking fears that it could be the third bank to fail after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\nAmid the biggest turmoil to hit the banking sector since 2008, the bank now faces tough options to turn around its business with the creation of a \u201cbad bank\u201d or asset sales possibilities, a source familiar with the matter said, after the lender showed the extent of deposit flight during last month\u2019s banking crisis.\n\n\u201cIf someone were to acquire them \u2026 there\u2019s going to be some big writedowns that would have to be taken against some of the assets given the rate cycle,\u201d Christopher Wolfe, head of North American banks at Fitch Ratings, told Reuters, referring to the bank\u2019s mortgage loan book and securities portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe options are very challenging and probably very costly, especially for shareholders,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to bear the cost?\u201d\n\nFirst Republic said on Monday it was \u201cpursuing strategic options\u201d to quickly strengthen the bank, without providing details.\n\nThe lender was studying all options, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.\n\nThe source said the bank wanted the US government to help by convening parties that could buoy San Francisco-based First Republic\u2019s fortunes, including private equity firms and big lenders.\n\nOptions include an asset sale of up to $100bn, a source familiar with the situation said. Bloomberg News earlier reported the chance of asset sales and said buyers might receive incentives such as warrants or preferred equity.\n\nThe bad bank possibility, earlier reported by CNBC, is a crisis-type method of isolating financial assets that have problems.\n\nThe latest woes in the banking sector were felt among other banks and the broader market with the KBW Regional Banking Index dropping 3.8% and the broader S&P 500 bank index down 2.6%.\n\nWall Street analysts expect challenges to extend through the year after failures at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature last month created a liquidity crunch at a slew of regional lenders.\n\nThe bank has been reeling as it navigates the twin challenges of assuring customers their deposits remain safe and investors that it has liquidity to emerge from the crisis.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The surprise move closed a case strange even by Florida standards.\n\nIn a deal that will probably see her released from prison within a year, Sheila Keen-Warren, 59, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\n\nLong suspected of being the shooter, she has been jailed awaiting trial for first-degree murder since 2017, when Palm Beach county sheriff\u2019s investigators said improvements in DNA technology proved a hair found in the clown\u2019s getaway car came from her.\n\nTrial was set to start next month. If convicted, Keen-Warren would have received a life sentence. Prosecutors sought a death sentence but dropped it.\n\nNo public notice was given for the plea hearing in West Palm Beach on Tuesday, which would have drawn reporters and spectators. Instead, it was handled quietly during the judge\u2019s lunch break from another murder trial.\n\nThe Palm Beach county state attorney, Dave Aronberg, said the plea deal \u201cobtained a measure of justice\u201d for Marlene Warren and her son.\n\n\u201cSheila Keen-Warren has finally been forced to admit that she was the one who dressed as a clown and took the life of an innocent victim. She will be a convicted murderer for the rest of her days,\u201d Aronberg said.\n\nKeen-Warren\u2019s lawyer, Greg Rosenfeld, said: \u201cThe state of Florida originally wanted to execute her, but now she is going home in 10 months. While it was difficult to plead guilty to a crime she did not commit, it was kind of a no-brainer when there is a guarantee that you will be home with your family.\u201d\n\nRosenfeld described \u201can incredible win for Ms Keen-Warren\u201d. The deal calls for a 12-year sentence but Keen-Warren has served six awaiting trial. Also, in 1990 Florida law allowed significant time off for good behavior, so Rosenfeld said he expected release early next year.\n\nAronberg\u2019s office said Keen-Warren would be in prison at least two more years.\n\nMarlene Warren\u2019s son, Joseph Ahrens, watched the Tuesday proceeding online. Only 21 when he saw his mother murdered, his only message to the court and Keen-Warren was, \u201cMay God be with her.\u201d\n\nKeen-Warren was an employee of Marlene Warren\u2019s husband, Michael, at his used car lot. Since 2002, she has been Michael Warren\u2019s wife.\n\nIn 1990, witnesses told investigators the two were having an affair, though both denied it.\n\nDetectives said costume shop employees identified Sheila Keen-Warren as the woman who bought a clown suit a few days before the killing. One of the two balloons \u2013 a silver one that read, \u201cYou\u2019re the Greatest\u201d \u2013 was sold at only one store, a Publix supermarket near Keen-Warren\u2019s home. Employees told detectives a woman who looked like her bought the balloons an hour before the shooting.\n\nThe presumed getaway car was found with orange, hair-like fibers inside. The white Chrysler convertible was reported stolen from Michael Warren\u2019s car lot a month before the shooting. Keen-Warren and her then husband repossessed cars for Warren.\n\nRelatives told the Palm Beach Post in 2000 that Marlene Warren, who was 40, suspected her husband was having an affair and wanted to leave him. But the car lot and other properties were in her name and she feared what might happen if she did.\n\nShe allegedly told her mother: \u201cIf anything happens to me, Mike done it.\u201d\n\nHe has never been charged and denies involvement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rosenfeld said the state\u2019s case was falling apart. One DNA sample somehow showed both male and female genes, he said, while the other could have come from one out of every 20 women, even Marlene Warren.\n\nEven if that hair did come from Keen-Warren, the lawyer said, it could have been deposited before the car was reported stolen. He said witnesses told detectives the car wasn\u2019t the killer\u2019s. Investigators insisted it was.\n\nAronberg conceded that there were holes in the case, caused by the three decades it took to get it to trial, including the death of key witnesses.\n\nIn 1994, Michael Warren was convicted of grand theft, racketeering and odometer tampering. He served almost four years in prison, a punishment his attorneys said was disproportionately long because of suspicions he was involved in his wife\u2019s death.\n\nOn Tuesday, he did not return a call seeking comment.","80":"Julie Su, President Joe Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Labor, was just 26 and two years out of Harvard Law School when she took on the defining case of her career that led to profound immigration and labor reforms.\n\nIn 1995, as a staff attorney at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, Su led a team of lawyers to secure legal immigration status and $4m in stolen wages for 72 enslaved Thai nationals in a garment sweatshop in El Monte, California. The case eventually led to federal protections for victims of human trafficking. Su, a Wisconsin-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, later earned a MacArthur genius award for her representation of the garment workers.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a creative, rigorous, incredibly committed public servant,\u201c said Ai-Jen Poo, a labor activist and the president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. \u201cGrowing up in an immigrant household and working as a civil rights lawyer gives her a unique perspective on both the incredible opportunities and the inequities that exist in this country.\u201d\n\nSu, now the deputy labor secretary, was nominated to lead the labor department in February, to replace outgoing Marty Walsh. She\u2019s facing an uphill battle to confirmation, though, with business lobbying groups and prominent Republicans campaigning against her. That was on display in the first confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, where Republicans criticized her record as California\u2019s labor secretary and a handful of moderate Democrats remained noncommittal about voting her through. (The Senate narrowly confirmed Su as deputy secretary in 2021 by three-vote margin, along party lines.)\n\nLabor advocates say Su\u2019s political career has been shaped by the enduring legacy of the El Monte sweatshop case \u2013 a grassroots campaign that \u201cturned my life upside down and changed me forever\u201d, Su has written.\n\nIf confirmed, the veteran civil rights attorney and California\u2019s former top labor official \u2013 who\u2019s endorsed by the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and more than a dozen Asian American advocacy groups \u2013 would be the first Asian American cabinet secretary to serve under Biden.\n\nAfter federal and state authorities freed the Thai garment workers in a pre-dawn raid, they were immediately sent to an immigration detention center and forced into orange prison uniforms. Su and her team secured their release after a week.\n\nThe workers, most of whom were women and undocumented, had been locked up in a factory surrounded by barbed wire, forced to toil from dawn to midnight for less than $1 an hour \u2013 some for as long as seven years.\n\nThe case pushed Congress to pass a landmark anti-trafficking law in 2000, which established a federal taskforce on human trafficking and created a new visa category for victims of crimes who assist law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe combination of having been a non-profit attorney representing workers of color in civil rights litigation, then moving into government, is unique among people in higher ranks of government,\u201d said Julia Figueira-McDonough, an attorney who has worked for Su for more than a decade at both Advancing Justice and the California labor commissioner\u2019s office. \u201cShe has a level of empathy and compassion that comes from her personal experience.\u201d\n\nOver the past three decades, as California\u2019s labor commissioner and labor secretary, Su has spearheaded programs to educate and protect garment workers who still toil in sweatshop conditions.\n\nPoo, of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, worked closely with Su while she was the California labor commissioner from 2011 to 2018. She said Su was particularly skilled at bringing together diverse stakeholders, including community organizers, business owners and elected officials, to address issues affecting domestic workers. In 2014, Su launched a sweeping \u201cWage Theft Is a Crime\u201d campaign to inform low-wage workers of their rights and how to report labor law abuses.\n\nThe El Monte case played a pivotal role in Su\u2019s career, but it also won her detractors. Some community organizers said Su, and the media, greatly exaggerated her involvement in the seminal 1995 anti-sweatshop movement that catapulted her to fame.\n\n\u201cJulie and the Legal Center completely hijacked the case from the Thai community and turned the spotlight on themselves,\u201d said Chanchanit Martorell, founder and executive director of the Thai Community Development Center, one of the social services groups that helped liberate, resettle and obtain redress for the garment workers.\n\nIn a 2020 letter to Biden opposing Su\u2019s nomination for deputy secretary, Martorell noted that, in contrast with Su\u2019s stated position as \u201clead attorney\u201d, she played only a \u201cminor role\u201d winning the multimillion-dollar settlement against the clothing manufacturers, nor was she responsible for securing the garment workers\u2019 release from immigration detention. More experienced lawyers bore the brunt of the legal work, including filing briefs, Martorell said, and social services groups attended to the survivors\u2019 housing and basic daily needs.\n\n\u201cFor the Thai community that stands for social justice,\u201d she said, \u201cwe really consider her exploiting the case for her own self-aggrandization as a betrayal.\u201d\n\nStewart Kwoh, then the executive director at the Legal Center (now known as Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California), said that Su and her team put in thousands of hours preparing garment workers for their depositions. He said that Su learned to speak some Thai and kept in touch with the workers long after the case settled. At the same time, he said, the settlement was the result of a multiyear, grassroots effort involving many LA-based lawyers and organizers whose roles were diminished in the news coverage.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it was a collective victory, but we don\u2019t control the media,\u201d said Kwoh, who worked with Su at Advancing Justice for 17 years. \u201cThere were a lot of people who contributed to it, and they should all take credit for the work done.\u201d\n\nAs the California labor secretary, a post she held from 2019 to 2021, Su expanded apprenticeship programs that trained workers without college degrees and initiatives to curtail wage theft. But she also faced fierce criticism from Republicans for the $30bn in unemployment fraud the state lost during the pandemic, and from business groups for helping craft AB5, a law that required companies to classify some independent contractors as employees.\n\nKent Wong, the director of the UCLA Labor Center who has known Su since the mid-1990s, said the heat she had received for the unemployment fraud scandal is unfair, since it was a result of an overwhelmed, outdated system ill-equipped to handle an avalanche of demands for cash assistance.\n\n\u201cIt was a problem in the making for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cTo hold the last person in charge responsible is wrong.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wong said, her stance on policies like AB5 is precisely what makes her such a qualified candidate for labor secretary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen unbridled corporate greed during the pandemic, epitomized by the Silicon Valley Bank scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have someone who\u2019s dedicated her life to supporting a living wage and the end of exploitation is a huge breakthrough.\u201d\n\nThe committee is expected to vote this week on whether to advance Su\u2019s confirmation to a full vote in the Senate.","81":"Former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has taken up three new roles at Harvard University, where she will study and speak on leadership, governance and online extremism.\n\nArdern announced in an Instagram post on Wednesday morning that she was \u201cincredibly humbled\u201d to be joining the university on joint fellowships at the Kennedy School\u2019s Center for Public Leadership and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, based at Harvard Law School.

So my father decided to go and take her and bring her to his own home.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn his way there his car started to get gunshots fired at it. He kept driving and then he decided to stop because the intensity and frequency of the gunshots increased. At this point, it was about two three hours just before sunset so he was still fasting, and someone from the RSF pulled him out of the car.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe can remember everything that happened. He said he was very faint, because it was very hot and he was scared. He did feel intense heat in his thigh, but he didn\u2019t look because of everything else that was going on.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe said the RSF were convinced her father was from the military but they let him go after he insisted he was a doctor who was trying to help his elderly and sick mother.\n\n\n\nDr A said: \u201cWhen he arrived at the house, my sister opened the door and she noticed there was blood on his clothes. He noticed the blood as well. They brought them inside and my uncle, who\u2019s a medic, tried to clean the wound and wrap it up.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr A said she is devastated that her grandmother cannot join her father on the evacuation, adding: \u201cI\u2019m trying to put pressure on the government and the Home Office because my dad cannot leave without my grandmother. She\u2019s an elderly lady, she\u2019s dependent and she\u2019s sick. Who\u2019s going to look after her when he leaves? And so it\u2019s a very difficult situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nMuhammed Elahi, a 27-year-old car dealer and former restaurant owner from Birmingham, said he is also unable to leave Sudan because he has been told his wife, Ghaliya, who is five months pregnant, cannot be evacuated because she is not a British citizen.\n\n\n\nHe told how he has repeatedly tried to get information from the British embassy about whether she could travel with him, saying: \u201cObviously, if my wife\u2019s not allowed to leave with me, I\u2019d have to stay here because no man is going to leave his pregnant wife in this situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe couple, who have lived in Sudan since they married in August, woke up to the sound of explosions as the fighting broke out near their apartment in Khartoum\u2019s Al-Riyadh district.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe could see thick black smoke from where bombs had been dropped and hear non-stop gunfire. There were fighter jets flying over our house. I was looking out the window and I think I could see the RSF firing anti-aircraft weapons in the air at the jets. The bullets were literally landing on my neighbour\u2019s roof,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nElahi, who had aspirations of opening a cafe in the capital, said he and his wife remained trapped in their apartment for days before deciding to flee just before Eid.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe electricity cut out and then the water cut out. So for three, four days we had no water or electricity and it was touching 40 degrees. It was unbearable. There was no shops open to get food from and we were fasting. We had little to no food so we basically began rationing, and then it just got so unbearable and we made a decision to leave,\u201d he said.\n\nThe couple travelled to a family friend\u2019s home on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\n\nElahi said his situation is complicated by the fact that he has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship in Birmingham. \u201cThat\u2019s been the hardest for me because I came here to make a better future for him. In a sense I feel like I kind of abandoned him.\u201d\n\nSoha Khattab and her husband Mazin Mohamed. His passport is in the British embassy and he cannot get access to it.

But it\u2019s now stuck.\u201d\n\n\n\nKhattab said they have not slept since the fighting broke out, which forced them to flee south to Gezira state.\n\nShe said: \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019re stuck and we are not sure where to go. We\u2019ve been given very conflicting information and we are not willing to risk our lives once again to travel elsewhere. Our journey here to Gezira was not a safe journey at all and we\u2019ve been stranded in the middle of nowhere. It took us 12 hours, there was no water and we\u2019d already been struggling for the past eight days so it\u2019s been really really disappointing that we\u2019ve been given no help or information from the British government.\u201d\n\nEibhlin Priestley, a Phd candidate at Cambridge University\u2019s history department who has both British and Irish citizenship, was evacuated by the German government.

She said she had received a message on Tuesday warning of an evacuation, but the British foreign office had told her they were not sure if she would be included among evacuations because she had travelled to Sudan on her Irish passport.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo get this, a pre-warning today, they\u2019re four days behind the EU, which is really shocking,\u201d she said.","83":"From 7h ago 17.36 BST UK PM says more than 1,000 people in Sudan contacted for evacuation Sunak added there would be \u201cmany more\u201d flights out of Sudan on Wednesday as citizens make their way to the airfield. \u201cWe now have over 100 people on the ground in Sudan.

A second military transport plane carrying British passport holders from Sudan is expected to land in Larnaca around midnight local time with a third arriving in the early hours as the massive evacuation operation of British citizens picks up steam.

It was not immediately clear if Bashir, who has spent extended periods in a military hospital, was at the prison, Reuters reports. The statement comes after reports that prisoners at Kober prison, which held Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and other top deputies, had staged a break earlier this week. Haroun said they were ready to appear in front of the judiciary whenever it was functioning, in a statement aired on Sudan\u2019s Tayba TV. Haroun appears to have made two statements, one to the TV station and a voice note. He said they went out to protect themselves after everyone fled from the prison including the guards. Aljazeera reported that Haroun\u2019s family said he been taken to the army hospital for medical checks.\n\nUpdated at 22.57 BST\n\n4h ago 21.21 BST Evacuees from Sudan arrive with a military plane at the Eindhoven Air Base military airport.

The post did not explicitly mention abortion \u2013 because Williams\u2019s day job was teaching Greek and Latin at a college for prospective Catholic priests near New Orleans.\n\nThe Benedictine-run St Joseph Seminary College has a policy against publicly expressing beliefs contrary to the established teachings of the Catholic church, which stridently opposes abortion. Despite the fact that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to recent polling, Williams wanted to comply with school policy. It didn\u2019t matter. The school fired him a week later.\n\n\u201cYour Facebook post publicly and deliberately advocated a position contrary to the official teaching of the Catholic Church,\u201d said the termination letter that St Joseph\u2019s rector, Gregory Boquet, gave Williams on 5 July. \u201cThe decision is to terminate your employment \u2026 effective immediately.\u201d\n\nWilliams, 40, has no real legal recourse to compel St Joseph to rehire him, according to lawyers he consulted and attorneys interviewed by the Guardian. Louisiana is an at-will employment state, which means employers can dismiss workers for any reason that is not blatantly unconstitutional.\n\nTwo New Orleans attorneys said it would be relatively viable to argue that Williams\u2019s Facebook post should qualify as constitutionally protected political speech. But Megan Kiefer and Chris Williams both said the seminary could persuasively argue its constitutional right to religious freedom, expressed through its policy, trumped Greg Williams\u2019s right to political speech.\n\nGreg Williams said he was now speaking up about the end of his seven-year tenure at St Joseph to shine a light on the harsh reality of at-will employment.\n\nHe said he found the college hypocritical, because it is part of a church which spent decades trying to suppress information about child sexual abuse by its clerics. The archdiocese which includes St Joseph, and which serves about half a million Catholics, has identified more than 80 priests and deacons strongly suspected of abusing minors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a thing to have [the church] have an official letter addressed to me saying I\u2019m doing heinous evil,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2013 what are you talking about?\u201d\n\nWilliams became a licensed pilot in 2009 and a couple of years later began flying for Pilots for Patients, a non-profit. Williams\u2019s role mostly sees him fly people with cancer for chemotherapy and radiation treatments not available to them locally. He only knows what medical care passengers are receiving if they choose to tell him.\n\nChristian but not Catholic, he landed a role teaching at St Joseph, near Covington, Louisiana, in 2015. The seminary had no problems with his volunteer work or other things that set his lifestyle apart from those of his students, including that he planned to start a family with his wife, Macey.\n\nBut then the supreme court handed down its abortion ruling, in the Dobbs v Jackson case. As an Episcopalian, Williams said, he wishes he lived in \u201ca world where abortion isn\u2019t needed any more\u201d because he believes life begins at conception and therefore a terminated pregnancy is \u201ca terrible tragedy\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just not the world we live in,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd my personal belief about abortion is, I\u2019m not going to be in that position as a man, and there\u2019s all kinds of stuff that might lead somebody to make that decision.\u201d\n\nWilliams said his role at St Joseph did not present opportunities to impose his personal beliefs on his students, and he wouldn\u2019t have done so even if it were possible. When, weeks after the Dobbs ruling, he decided to offer to fly any women in need of out-of-town medical care, he did so on a private Facebook page.\n\nInitial reactions were positive.\n\n\u201cYour heart is gold,\u201d one woman wrote.\n\nA man said: \u201cYou sir are a damn hero.\u201d\n\nBut soon someone filed a complaint with St Joseph, accusing Williams of undermining official Catholic teaching and causing \u201ca public scandal\u201d.\n\nThe complainant\u2019s identity has never been shared with Williams, whose termination letter was emailed by Boquet, the school rector. The same day, Williams\u2019s academic dean provided a glowing recommendation for his search for a new job.\n\n\u201cIn all of his courses he was evaluated with the top 10% of our faculty,\u201d read the recommendation letter from Daniel Burns, who described Williams as \u201ca dynamic lecturer\u201d and \u201cinfectiously passionate\u201d.\n\nThe letter added: \u201cI personally will miss his engaging conversation and his ability to speak competently across disciplines.\u201d\n\nSt Joseph officials did not respond to requests for comment. Pilots for Patients provided a statement saying flights for abortions fall outside the organization\u2019s mission but acknowledged it does not control what trips its unpaid volunteers might take on during their own time.\n\nWilliams said he found new work at an Episcopal church. Since his dismissal from St Joseph, he said, he had flown about 15 people through Pilots for Patients.\n\nHe noted an irony. For all of St Joseph\u2019s talk favoring life, he said, the only thing delaying his plans to have a baby with Macey has been the school\u2019s decision to fire him.\n\n\u201cHaving lost my job \u2026 I can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou want to talk about pro-life? They\u2019ve literally prevented me and my wife from starting a family.\u201d","85":"A group of leading Russian lawyers on Tuesday asked the country\u2019s highest court to declare unconstitutional a law banning criticism of the armed forces, in a rare display of opposition to the draconian censorship imposed by the Kremlin in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe complaint, filed by three lawyers and supported by 10 more, most of whom are still in Russia, asked the Constitutional Court to strike down the measure, which has emerged as the Kremlin\u2019s most effective tool for stifling dissent in the country.\n\n\u201cThis law was passed with only one goal \u2014 to suppress antiwar activism,\u201d said Violetta Fitsner, a lawyer with OVD-Info, a Russian rights group, and one of the authors of the complaint. \u201cSuch restrictions cannot exist in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nThe censorship laws effectively ban anything that does not correspond to the Kremlin\u2019s depiction of the war, which it continues to call a \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d They have virtually silenced debate in Russia.","86":"Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, hinted on Tuesday at the possibility of a prisoner swap involving two Americans detained in Russia, Paul Whelan and the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.\n\nSpeaking at a wide-ranging news conference at the United Nations, Mr. Lavrov said the channel to discuss detained American and Russian citizens was created when President Biden and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, met in Geneva in 2021. Back then, Mr. Lavrov said, the channel did not provide \u201cfor the involvement of journalists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is work that is not public in nature and publicity here will only complicate the process,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said at the U.N., where Russia is wrapping up a contentious monthlong stint as president of the Security Council, a rotating position.\n\nMr. Lavrov said that several American citizens were serving prison sentences in Russia for various crimes, but that Mr. Whelan and Mr. Gershkovich had been detained \u201cwhen they were committing a crime, receiving material\u201d that he maintained consisted of state secrets.","87":"Biden is running for re-election\n\nIn a video message, President Biden formally kicked off his campaign for the 2024 presidential race, urging voters to let him \u201cfinish this job.\u201d\n\nHis announcement did not mention Donald Trump \u2014 his most likely opponent \u2014 but the subtext of his messaging was clear: He views himself as the best person to stop Trump from reclaiming the presidency.\n\nAt 80, Biden is already the oldest American president in history. (Trump is 76.) Yet he has all but cleared the Democratic presidential field despite concerns about his age. Although polls show that Democrats yearn for a fresh face in 2024, they just don\u2019t know who that would be.\n\nKamala Harris, his vice president, will probably face scrutiny and intense Republican criticism; she would take over if something happened to Biden, who would be 86 at the end of his tenure.","88":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Taliban have killed the leader of the Islamic State cell responsible for the suicide bombing at the international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021 that killed 13 U.S. troops and as many as 170 civilians, the White House said on Tuesday.\n\nFour senior American officials said that U.S. intelligence analysts became aware in early April that the mastermind of the attack, whom they declined to identify, had died in a Taliban operation in Afghanistan. It was unclear whether the Taliban were specifically targeting the insurgent or he was killed in one of the increasing number of attacks between Taliban and Islamic State fighters, the officials said.\n\nJohn F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, called the Taliban operation \u201canother in a series of high-profile leadership losses\u201d that the Islamic State cell, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, had suffered this year.\n\nThe officials said that based on classified intelligence reports \u2014 most likely from informants, electronic intercepts or information from allied spy services \u2014 analysts concluded with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the chief plotter of the airport attack had been killed. But the officials offered no evidence to support that conclusion or other details about his purported death.","89":"This article is part of our special report on the Art for Tomorrow conference in the Italian cities of Florence and Solomeo.\n\nMOMBASA, Kenya \u2014 It is a tale of three cities.\n\nTo the north up the Kenyan coast is Lamu Town, its small streets humming with the sounds of chisels and hammers crafting Swahili doors, and donkeys carrying heavy loads of coral limestone. Locals and tourists jockey for space in the zigzagging alleys, with shops selling everything from silver jewelry to body products made with locally grown baobab.\n\nDown the coast, in neighboring Tanzania, is Stone Town of Zanzibar, with its bustling fish market, where hauls of octopus and snapper come in daily from dhow boats, and countless Polish, English, Italian and Mandarin-speaking travelers shuffle through on tours that also take them to a memorial near the site of the city\u2019s former slave market.\n\nAnd between the two sits Old Town Mombasa and at its eastern tip, Fort Jesus, an imposing 16th-century structure built by the Portuguese, its multiple openings offering glorious views of the Indian Ocean, and gentle breezes that help stave off the coastal heat.\n\nBut while these streets are busy, too, here in Old Town Mombasa, it\u2019s mostly locals, unlike in the other two locales, where throngs of tourists flood the streets.","90":"This account became a parable of poor scientific behavior, leading to a backlash against Dr. Watson and Dr. Crick and turning Dr. Franklin into a feminist icon. It also set off a long-running debate among historians: Precisely what role did Dr. Franklin play in the discovery of the double helix, and to what extent was she wronged?\n\nIn a new opinion essay, published in Nature on Tuesday, two scholars argue that what transpired \u201cwas less malicious than is widely assumed.\u201d The scholars, Matthew Cobb, a zoologist and historian at the University of Manchester who is writing a biography of Dr. Crick, and Nathaniel Comfort, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins University who is writing a biography of Dr. Watson, draw upon two previously overlooked documents in Dr. Franklin\u2019s archive.\n\nThese documents, they say, suggest that Dr. Franklin knew that Dr. Watson and Dr. Crick had access to her data and that she and Dr. Wilkins collaborated with them. \u201cWe should be thinking of Rosalind Franklin, not as the victim of DNA, but as an equal contributor and collaborator to the structure,\u201d Dr. Comfort said.\n\nOther experts said that the new documents were interesting but did not radically change the narrative; it has long been clear that Dr. Franklin played a key role in the discovery. \u201cWhat this does is add a little new evidence to a trail, which leads directly to Franklin\u2019s being a major participant,\u201d said David Oshinsky, a historian of medicine at New York University.\n\nAnd regardless of what Dr. Franklin knew about who had access to her data, the new documents do not change the fact that she did not receive adequate recognition for her work, some historians said.","91":"Dr. Mitchell and his colleagues looked at maximum daily temperatures around the world between 1959 and 2021. They found that regions covering 31 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface experienced heat so extraordinary that, statistically, it shouldn\u2019t have happened. These places, the study argues, are now prepared to some degree for future severe hot spells.\n\nBut there are still many areas that, simply by chance, haven\u2019t yet experienced such extreme heat. So they might not be as prepared.\n\nAccording to the study, these include economically developed places like Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, plus the region of China around Beijing. But they also include developing countries like Afghanistan, Guatemala, Honduras and Papua New Guinea, that are more likely to lack resources to keep people safe.\n\nOther areas at particular risk include far eastern Russia, northwestern Argentina and part of northeastern Australia.\n\nThe study was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nWhy this is important\n\nIn 2021, a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest shattered local records by staggering margins. Hundreds of people in Washington and Oregon may have died because of the heat. Crops shriveled. Wildfire destroyed the village of Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nThe new study shows that hot spells which fall outside the range of statistical plausibility have occurred all over the world throughout the past few decades. This suggests they could happen again, anywhere, though not all of them will be as off-the-charts as the recent Pacific Northwest one.","92":"Carlson did so by embracing Trumpism but not Trump himself. The approach was partly personal. In private texts, Carlson said of Trump, \u201cI hate him passionately.\u201d It also helped Carlson differentiate himself from other Fox News hosts, Nicholas said. Because they aligned themselves closely with Trump, the hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham would often have to come to his defense when Trump said something outrageous. Carlson tried to avoid those pitfalls by focusing on the underlying message instead of Trump as the public face of it.\n\nFox\u2019s predominantly white audience embraced Carlson\u2019s approach, and he drew more than three million viewers a night, regularly making his show No. 1 or No. 2 at the network. And although accusations of bigotry and falsehoods prompted sponsors to flee Fox, Carlson\u2019s show increased its ad revenue because its audience was so large.\n\nCarlson has not said what he\u2019ll do next. But without that big audience, he probably won\u2019t be as influential.\n\nUncertain future\n\nFox News said it would rotate hosts in its 8 p.m. slot until it could find a permanent replacement. At first glance, this seems bad for the network: Not only did it lose one of its biggest stars, but it has no replacement lined up. And the announcement comes at a time when Fox has already faced months of bad publicity, and it just agreed to a $787.5 million settlement over Dominion\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nBut Fox has overcome similar challenges with its hosts before. Carlson himself replaced Bill O\u2019Reilly, who was once the network\u2019s most popular host, and not only maintained O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings but at times surpassed them. That experience may have led Fox to believe that the network carries more sway over its viewers than individual hosts do.","93":"After more than a year of surprisingly solid European unity in support of Ukraine, grains of discord are piling up in the barn of Robert Vieru, a Romanian farmer with 500 tons of wheat and 250 tons of sunflower seeds now sitting unsold because of cut-price Ukrainian competition.\n\nA glut of Ukrainian cereals and other produce has nearly halved the value for the results of Mr. Vieru\u2019s labors and left farmers across Eastern and Central Europe \u2014 and their governments, most of which face elections this year or next \u2014 caught between solidarity with Ukraine and their own survival.\n\n\u201cI feel sad for them but my heart breaks for myself,\u201d Mr. Vieru said of Ukrainians living across the nearby border in Romania\u2019s Danube River delta, as he opened the sliding door of a concrete barn, filled to the brim with last year\u2019s unsold harvest.\n\nPrices have been driven so low by a flood of cheap food from Ukraine, he said, that selling would mean earning less than he paid to produce his crops.","94":"WASHINGTON \u2014 When the Russian Army took Kherson in southern Ukraine, the occupation authorities offered 16-year-old Anastasia a chance to go to Crimea, a holiday away from war, the officials told her mother.\n\nBut as days became weeks, Anastasia realized that she had not been given a vacation and that the Russians might not let her return home.\n\nIt was only when a nonprofit group, Save Ukraine, sent Anastasia\u2019s mother on a bus to find her that she was able to get out.
